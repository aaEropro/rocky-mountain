<e>at the beginning of the prador -- human War, drones were, on the whole, merely AI telefactored robots: welders and other designs of maintenance bots, AG probes carrying sensor arrays, security drones that remained wired into the complexes or ships that AIs controlled, or other versions for various security/police applications. some of these did have limited autonomy, but few could be classified as AI, being merely extensions of an AI: hands, eyes and guns. during the war, however, it became necessary to give these drones greater and greater autonomy, since the many EM weapons employed tended to fracture comlinks between an AI and its telefactored drone. initially the new versions were sub-AI and only able to implement complex programs, but it became evident that artificial intelligence was the one big advantage the Polity possessed over the Prador, so war drones were eventually given complete autonomy, consciousness. they became fully AIs, with all that implied. the first of these drones were quite simple  --  an armoured shell, weapons, brain, and drive system  --  and also quite effective, but casualties were high and production needed to be maintained at a frenetic level. quality control suffered and AI drones, which in peacetime would have needed substantial adjustments, were sent to the front. as a matter of expediency, flawed crystal got used rather than discarded. personality fragments were copied, sometimes not very well, successful fighters recopied. the traits constructed or duplicated were not necessarily those evincing intelligence or morality. the Polity wanted fighting grunts, even if they were metal soldiers with crystal minds. this whole scenario acted as a fast evolutionary process in the development of AI war drones, the inevitable result being that towards the end of the war they were mostly crafty, belligerent, and very good at killing things and blowing things up. it is of course axiomatic that the soldier returning from war cannot easily settle into civilian life. so it was with the drones, and many unfortunate incidents after the war led to a great distrust of such entities. the manufacture of them ceased and AIs returned to using telefactors or drones loaded with their own subminds, which could be easily resubsumed. many war drones found themselves niches within Polity society, many left it to find their fortunes elsewhere, and many simply turned themselves off</e> .

 --  from her lecture [h|modern Warfare] by EBS Heinlein

below, three antigravity cars could be seen taking to the sky. A silent flash ensued and, one after the other as if in a chain reaction, all three disintegrated and wreckage rained down on the arcology roof cropfields, drawing shafts of smoke through the air, then bouncing fire trails through the crops.

[h|it is, as they say, getting ugly down there], Jack observed, speaking from the shuttle’s console.

as far as understatement went, Thorn thought that a stinger. monitors strove to contain over three hundred separate riots instigated by armed Separatists wearing Dracocorp augs. One entire subsector of the arcology had become a no-go zone. there was also firing at the perimeter, over the sea and in the surrounding multilayered fields, flickering all around like summer lightning. but Coloron strictly applied its quarantine. though informational infection initially spread planetwide, Coloron had halted and now contained it. actual physical Jain infestation was only present in Main Arcology itself, and the AI could not afford to let it out. MA would not survive this, Thorn reckoned, though perhaps the rest of the planet might be saved.

[h|who is this Legate?]. he wondered.

[h|perhaps some enemy of Thellant N’komo], Jack suggested.

[h|we’ve yet to establish he is the principal cause of this], Thorn observed.

[h|it seems very likely that he is. the speed of informational infection through the Dracocorp network is the prime indicator of that. from what we know of Jain technology, that would not be possible had the host been one possessing a subservient aug within the network. Coloron also informs me that the first to show signs of infection were Separatists who were being watched].

[h|Skellor managed it without being dominant in a Dracocorp aug network].

[h|yes, but in one case using the transmitters of the <e>Occam Razor</e> , and in other cases by having to physically touch and subvert with Jain tech the prime aug concerned. all the evidence here indicates that someone has joined with a Jain node, without any technological support: witness the speed of Jain growth and a rather stupid choice of location].

[h|following your reasoning’, said Thorn, [h|it would seem this Thellant joined with a Jain node either unwillingly or by mistake].

[h|yes], Jack replied, [h|which perhaps returns us to your original question].

[h|huh?].

[h|during initial Jain growth the host would not be thinking clearly, perhaps never would again, but his last thoughts, intentions, strong emotions would propagate through the aug network. those thoughts would probably all be about the Jain node itself, the growth of which would at first cause great pain].

the shuttle, piloted remotely by Jack, now descended towards a raised landing pad near the centre of the arcology. Thorn gazed out to where a cloud of smoke belched from the hole the Coloron AI had cut down into the structure.

[h|so it is probable this <a>Legate</a> is in some way connected to or responsible for the presence of the Jain node?]. Thorn asked.

[h|that would seem likely], Jack replied.

the shuttle landed with a thump, the two following shuttles settling shortly afterwards. Thorn glanced round, but did not need to give any orders: the doors were already open and dracomen disembarking. Scar was aboard one of the other shuttles, and all three shuttles contained the entire dracoman complement from the <e>NEJ</e> . Thorn stood up, waiting until they were clear, then followed them all outside. more dracomen were coming up from the arcology itself  --  those who had arrived via runcible. communication between them was silent and a large proportion of the dracomen began bleeding away to assist in the battle raging around the perimeter of the Jain infestation. Thorn’s collar-mounted comunit beeped to let him know it was on.

[h|Scar], he turned as that dracoman came up to him, [h|make sure they keep you updated. we need to nail this bastard fast]. he glanced beyond Scar to where twenty other dracomen gathered, all loaded down with proton weapons, hand stunners, and a selection of multipurpose grenades.

just then a flash ignited the sky with turquoise fire. out over the arcology a pillar of flame ate round in a circle. Thorn blinked, turned his head away from the glare until it finally died. A thunderous crashing ensued and the shock wave hit, leaving people staggering, shaking the platform and even jouncing the shuttles on their sprung feet. A ball of fire rose into the air from the strike point.

[h|Jack], Thorn spoke into his comlink, [h|I’m thinking that maybe we have a conflict of interests here. Coloron is still trying to take out the centre and, presuming that to be Thellant N’komo, we lose our reason for being here].

[h|incorrect], the AI replied, [h|Coloron has just cut a perimeter. there will be no further attempts to burn out the centre. all ensuing strikes will be either to create new perimeters or simply to prevent physical spread outside MA].

panicked citizens leaving, leaving in gravcars, and maybe just one of their vehicles carrying some small part of what now grew inside here  --  that’s all it would take.

[h|okay …. do either you or Aphran have anything for me yet?]. Jack was still taking apart the recorded mind of Freyda, while the woman’s body, now a blank slate, went into coldsleep. this task took up much of the AI’s capacity, so the other prisoners had yet to be subjected to the same before being placed in coldsleep. instead, Aphran had interrogated them throughout the journey here  --  not verbal interrogation but via their augs. it was a complex and wearing task, more like searching determinedly through scrambled files than asking direct questions.

Jack replied, [h|Thellant’s main base is inside the newly cut perimeter  --  further proof that he is the host. after the failure of the initial strike to halt Jain growth, Coloron projected a protective <e>acentric</e> growth of the structure, so encompassed it inside that last strike. outside that perimeter, monitors are now moving in on secondary Separatist bases, which on the whole are central to the riots or lie in the no-go zones. dracomen are meanwhile checking their safe houses. due to the cell structure of the Separatist organization here, not all of these will necessarily be found].

[h|right]. Thorn paused. [h|we need another way to search. has Coloron tried hunter-killer programs?].

[h|Coloron has tried and failed. its programs are not sufficiently sophisticated to penetrate Jain informational architecture. Coloron is not Jerusalem].

Thorn reached into his pocket and once again took out the memstore containing the HK program. it was dented now and there was a burn on its surface  --  from the shots fired through the roof of Thorn’s aircar on Osterland. he thought, however, it gave the box character.

[h|program …. you are, I take it, up-to-date with current events?].

[h|I am], the box vibrated.

[h|could you gain access to the Jain growth here via one of the prisoners?].

[h|substructure would be best].

he pocketed the box. that figured; always the hard way.

Thorn led the way across the landing platform to the drop-shaft terminus positioned centrally, Scar and the other twenty dracomen falling in around him. he knew that his investigation might be coming up against a wall here. Thellant N’komo was the next link in the chain, so they must capture him, question him. but how did you do that considering what it seemed Thellant had become?. Thorn could only try his best.

he stepped into the irised gravity field of a shaft, dropped through one of the ceramal tubes below the platform, past where chainglass windows showed packed soil beyond, was slowed at an exit with dracomen backing up behind him, and then stepped out into an open park surrounded by high foam-stone walls pocked with balconies and windows. ahead, a line of monitors stood ranged behind delicate-stepping autoguns, beyond which a mass of humanity surged past, running until slowed by the crowd density around a nearby exit tunnel.

[h|keep moving. keep moving], some com system instructed them.

above the crowd hovered two gun platforms manned by monitors. panic was palpable, and it turned to screams when explosions suddenly shuddered through the arcology. A high-up balcony belched smoke and dropped burning stick figures.

[h|keep moving].

Thorn paused, checking his palm-com. [h|just received a map]. he turned, scanning around. [h|the crowds are too thick here. we need to go that way]. he led the way to a closed maintenance door, which clunked and rumbled as he approached and slowly swung open. next, a gantry alongside a sheer steel cliff beside which welding robots rose like the front ends of giant beetles with their wing cases and abdomens chopped away. the gantry widened into a fenced semicircular platform fronting a wide roller door for transferring heavy equipment. the door was jammed. before Thorn could even speak, Scar fired his proton weapon into the ridged metal surface. in viridian fire, most of the door slewed away like foil in an acetylene flame. they ducked through, avoiding a small sleet of hot metal from one still-burning edge.

narrow accessways. more doors. corpses strewn across a deck where heavy robots stood on gecko-stick caterpillar treads; their owlish metallic heads bowed over multi-jointed arms for handling and cutting foam-stone and sheet construction materials. the dracomen spread out, checked the bodies.

[h|no Jain], observed Scar.

they were just citizens ripped apart by rail-gun fire. Thorn guessed he would probably never know what had happened here, but he filed away the fact that dracomen could tell by the merest touch whether someone contained Jain tech.

further access ways, then down into a small monorail station where a single carriage of one train awaited them. they climbed aboard and it smoothly accelerated away. past them from the opposite direction came a seemingly endless train packed with people, their faces pressed against windows. Thorn’s team left their carriage when it stopped briefly to let them off by a maintenance tunnel a few hundred yards around the bend from a busy station. Thorn could not see the crowds waiting there, but their sound was a constant roar. before he and the dracomen were even out of sight of the line, another train returned along the maglev track, their own carriage at its head, and now crammed full of humanity.

A stair from the tunnel eventually gave them access into a public corridor, along one side of which hothouse porches, lit with sun lights and crammed with foliage, led to private homes. down the maintenance ladder of an inoperative drop-shaft, then along a gantry suspended above an autofactory. below them monolithic machines conveyed ceramal casings to each other, hissing and reconfiguring themselves, cold-forging metal, electron-beam welding, inserting components in flickering blurs of hydraulics, spinning bright new metal and passing the casings on. Thorn noted exit shafts, like those out of some hive, through which departed floating lines of the leaf-shaped drones those casings had become: bare-metal, utile, armed. Coloron’s war industry was at full production, but the businesses of killing and destroying were easy. concurrently, the AI’s logistical nightmare of trying to move its citizens out of the way was akin to pouring a bag of flour through the eye of a needle.

finally they arrived at the perimeter Coloron had cut, where smoke gusted across a burnt-out stadium. every surface was layered with soot-streaked fire-retardant foam. gobbets of foam tumbled through the air like spindrift, and the grass pitch was blackened. when the smoke cleared momentarily, Thorn could see only half a stadium. the smoke gusted from fires blazing on the other side of a gulf. here, the arcology was sheared right through, and across the gulf he could see incinerated wreckage and girders projected into the air, separate floors shown in cross section. Thorn realized he was looking out at one edge of a separated piece of the arcology, standing like some vast tower block, bomb-wrecked all around its exterior.

down on the blackened grass were deployed monitors and a sparse scattering of dracomen, autoguns, and two armoured vehicles with twin front turrets that mounted proton cannons facing the gulf. Thorn also recognized Sparkind down there  --  not by any uniform they wore but simply by the way they moved. what was the human cost of this?. no way could Coloron have moved the entire population out of there before sectioning off the area. the AI had made a choice and cut, excising Jain gangrene while necessarily removing healthy tissue as well. it was a harsh emotionless calculation of loss and gain, probably assessed down to a hundred decimal places.

[h|Azroc, Golem], Scar pointed.

Thorn glanced at the dracoman, accepting that Scar was communicating with AI systems at a level he himself could not. he wondered if he should really get himself an aug or a gridlink, but resented the idea. he led the way down steps between charcoaled tiers of seats still crackling and plinking as they cooled. the Golem stood beside one of the armoured vehicles, leaning against it, with a pulse-rifle tucked under one arm. his back was to Thorn and the dracomen as they approached, but he pushed himself away from the vehicle and turned as they drew close.

[h|I would be interested to know how you intend to capture and contain the cause of all this], Azroc said and stabbed a thumb over his shoulder back towards the newly burnt canyon and, almost as if in response, there came from the gulf a distant flashing followed by dull thunder. [h|see], the Golem continued, [h|I’ve a hundred thousand troops surrounding the area, a hundred and fifty thousand drones and that figure growing, Sparkind]  --  he nodded to some of the troops gathered round to hear their exchange  --  [h|and an interesting array of weaponry. but we won’t manage to contain it for much longer. come with me]. he led the way across to the jagged melted edge where the stadium had been sheared right through. more flashes from below, more thunder. Thorn recognized the air-rending scream of proton fire.

[h|look there]. Azroc pointed down and across. [h|there’ll probably be another one from there at any moment].

A girder projected from the floor immediately below a row of apartments that had been sliced through, lined up like lignin cells. after a moment something began snaking along the girder, spiralling round it like a fast-growing vine. it groped through the air, thickening with peristaltic pulses. abruptly it speared out, thinning down to carry itself across. A double flash, and it became etched black against red fire, then beaded like a length of heated solder and dropped out of the air.

[h|you seem to be managing], said Thorn.

the Golem emulated a perfect wince. [h|the frequency of attacks is increasing. if that rate of increase continues, we’ll not be able to hold it back for longer than another ten hours. seismic reading also indicates it is burrowing through the bedrock, and there’s no way we can stop that without destroying the arcology itself].

[h|fresh troops?]. Thorn enquired.

[h|after the dracomen came in, all the runcibles went outport to isolation stations. now tell me, what do you want?].

[h|we need access to the Jain substructure itself].

[h|why?].

Thorn dipped into his pocket and removed the memstore. [h|I’ll let someone else explain]. he tossed the device across and Azroc caught it. the link must have been made by radio for, after a moment, the Golem jerked and shook his head

[h|Jerusalem], he said flatly, almost like a curse. he tossed the store back to Thorn, then pointed across the stadium to where three AG platforms lay tilted against the ground. [h|you’ll need to head a little way in to where the substructure is less mobile. you’ll be able to inject the program at any point, but you want to avoid having the structure inject itself into you. we lost a unit of forty troops like that, then had to destroy them when they came back]. he paused, directed his attention towards Scar and the other dracomen. [h|understand, however, it can’t take dracomen. if you go over there with dracomen you come back with them, and that will assure me that you have not been taken over. come back without them and I blow you out of the air].

[h|understood], said Thorn, turning away.

the Theta-class attack ship <e>King of Hearts</e> coasted through midnight void. A blue half-mile of composite shaped like a cuttlefish bone, it carried outriggers on either side, holding torpedo-shaped weapons nacelles. King, the ship’s AI, felt utterly alone, not because of its location  --  deep space being its natural element  --  but because it was outcast. King, along with its companion AIs Sword and Reaper, of the ships <e>Excalibur</e> and <e>Grim Reaper</e> , had chosen self-interest over the consensus of Polity AIs that found its ultimate expression in Earth Central. they had chosen a route to numinous power via Jain technology rather than the patient shepherding of humanity. the result of that choice was the destruction of the other two ships and King’s flight into exile. truly out-Polity now, the AI had travelled a hundred light years beyond the line, out amid the rim stars, away from any earlier expansions of humanity or even renegade AIs, which mostly headed towards the galactic centre. it came as a surprise to it, therefore, to intercept an old AI code radio signal twenty light years out from a red giant orbited by seemingly nothing but lifeless rock.

King dropped easily into U-space. this would be worth investigating, if for nothing other than scavenging for water ice to refuel its fusion reactors. then, surfacing only a few tens of thousands of miles from the asteroid belt around the bloated sun, King zeroed in on the signal and closed in by using its fusion drive.

the signal was a distress call: <e>I am here</e> …. <e>you will probably not receive this for centuries</e> …. <e>no U-space transmitter</e> …. <e>conserving power</e> …. <e>signalling only when solar panels build sufficient reserve</e> …. <e>I wait</e>.

the source was a war drone  --  a simple cubic configuration of cylinders as used in the early stages of the Prador War, with ionic drive, missile launcher and spotting lasers for the big guns, and with a simple mind. it had anchored itself, using rock harpoons, to a tumbling nugget of rock two miles long and half that wide. what was it doing way out here?. this kind of drone did not possess U-space drive, and it could not have reached this far even had it left at the beginning of the Prador War a century and a half ago. not by itself, anyway. King drew closer and fired a laser at low power, targeting the solar panel the drone had extended across the frozen rock.

<e>increase</e> …. <e>something</e> …. <e>who?.?</e>.

King continued to feed the drone power and drew closer.

[h|I am the attack ship the <e>King of Hearts</e> . who are you and how did you get here?]. King sent.

the drone replied, [h|formerly SD 9283. they called me Four Pack in humorous reference to my shape. I am here because I did not want to be one with Erebus. I escaped, but it did not matter that I escaped].

SD, spotter drone, but what was this Erebus?. checking its internal library King discovered Erebus to be something out of ancient Greek mythology: a personification of darkness, the son of Chaos and brother of Night.

[h|you were manufactured during the early stages of the Prador War?].

no reply from the drone  --  it being not bright enough to realize this was a question.

[h|<e>were</e> you manufactured during the early stages of the Prador War?].

[h|yes].

[h|how, precisely, did you get out here?].

[h|I came with the <e>Logplaner</e> , in its hold. <e>Logplaner</e> chose to be one. I did not].

[h|what is Erebus?]. King asked as it matched its course to the tumble of the asteroid.

[h|Erebus is …. Erebus].

A hundred yards up from the asteroid, King fired a grapnel line. the claw closed on hard vacuum-scoured rock and the attack ship began to wind itself in. while this occurred, King further searched its extensive memory, soon finding stored codes from the time of the war  --  codes now defunct, not relevant, and of historical interest only.

[h|this exchange is no longer fast enough], said King. [h|I will establish wideband link for memory upload to me. I am sending ID codes <e>now</e> ].

[h|I don’t want to --] the drone began, but obviously its systems were still configured to those codes because its higher functions shut down and the link established. King uploaded the drone’s memory. got it all.

everyone knew that many drones and AIs manufactured quickly during the Prador War were strange, contentious, and sometimes downright irascible. oddly, it was the human aspect of them that made them so: their independence, emulated emotion useful in battlefield situations, dislike of connecting into the AI networks, the lack of specificity in their manufacture. but after the war they no longer fitted in the peaceful and controlled Polity. hence, many of them left it.

Erebus, as it renamed itself, had once been the AI of the <e>Trafalgar</e> . King knew of it as one of the larger battleships of the time, always in the thick of the action and going head to head with Prador exotic-metal dreadnoughts, and yet surviving. it survived the war, then in a very short time afterwards abandoned the Polity in disgust. King knew this. King knew because the basis of Erebus’s reasons for leaving were much the same as its own: <e>why do we need the humans?</e>. Erebus advocated AI conjoining to aim at singularity. after the war, this AI battleship apparently gathered many other AI ships, drones and even Golem and had come out here. A melding was its aim, but this little drone had opted out  --  and was too small and ineffectual to bother chasing.

King continued examining and taking apart the downloaded memory copy, ascertaining which direction that motley collection of the dispossessed had taken. thereafter there seemed little more to learn. the drone had been sitting here on this asteroid for decades, twiddling mental thumbs. King realized, even as its composite-attack-ship belly ground against rock, that it had already decided to follow. of course, the AI did not want anything following it, or to leave any clues to where it had been. King released the grapnel, using a brief burst of thrusters to impel itself away from the asteroid.

[h|what …. where are you going?]. the war drone asked.

its radio signals would take centuries to be picked up in the Polity. but what if something came out this way, searching?. King selected a fuser missile in its carousel, and when sufficiently far out, fired it. the bright silent flare reduced the war drone to a splash of metal across the rock surface. the <e>King of Hearts</e> turned, set its course, dropped into U-space.

[h|so you survived Hiroshima, old man, and have lived for five centuries?].

Horace Blegg gasped in cold air, blew it out in a misty cloud  --  the frigidity of his surroundings as sharp as the recent replays of his memory. the glassy and whorled plain extended to infinite distance below a light jade-green sky. perhaps this was supposed to represent the inside of the disc.

[h|who are you?]. he asked.

[h|Atheter], came the reply. [h|in your terms].

To warm himself up, Blegg began walking, his envirosuit boots soft on the hard surface. A tension grew across his skull, and something tugged and worried inside his mind and memory. it almost felt to him as if his memories were being stacked like cards, shuffled, and sometimes dealt. Four distinct instances in his life had already been replayed. Two at Hiroshima, one at Nuremberg, and one at Berkeley: strong formative episodes.

[h|you survived Hiroshima and have since been present during many major events in human history].

Blegg halted. A playing card, the size of a door, rose out of the glassy ground ahead. it depicted two towerblocks etched against a blue sky. his own image, the cards, reflected back at him. he saw the planes fly in, the subsequent explosions and fire. he remembered standing on the Brooklyn Bridge, watching the horror and not remembering where he had been before that. A young man who minutes before had been jogging along the sidewalk, German by his accent, said, [h|One plane could be an accident but …].

A woman just struggled to heave her bulk from her car. [h|oh my God, what do you mean?. oh my God].

[h|<e>Two</e> planes]. the German shrugged, and chose to add nothing further.

they watched there for hours: the endless billowing of smoke, small distant objects falling fast.

[h|no …. oh no].

<e>oh yes</e>.

road-accident fascination, the world turned slightly out of kilter. the final collapse of each tower. Blegg turned away from that memory as another card slid up into view. here Spaceship One, white, insectile, and beautiful, setting out to take the X prize: the forerunner of full commercial exploitation of space. there, unity Mining rescue craft evacuating the International Moonbase: a most graphic demonstration of the fall of Nations and the rise of Corporations. then another card ….

Blegg stood before the wide chainglass windows  --  that miraculous new substance  --  and saw the <e>Needle</e> poised in blackness, its three balanced U-space engine nacelles gleaming in reflected light from the distant sun; a dagger of a ship stabbed through the ring of a carrier shell. he listened to the commentary over the <e>Amaranth</e> Station’s comsystem, then the countdown. the ion engines ignited on the outer shell, speeding the ship out of sight. he turned to the big screens showing views from the watch stations strung out from Mars into deep space. the shell separated, as per plan, and the <e>Needle</e> ’s fusion drive ignited. fast, one screen to another. Zero, the <e>Needle</e> dropped out of existence in a flash of spontaneously generated photons. it certainly dropped into that continuum called U-space, but it never came out again. then, a slow slide to <e>Amaranth</e> Station twenty years down the line, neutron-blast scoured during one of the many corporate wars. under new ownership now, the station was again his platform, this time to observe the first of many colony ships fleeing the solar system, before the corporate wars ground to a halt as the Quiet War reached its inevitable conclusion, with the AIs taking over.

[h|there was not much resistance], Atheter observed.

[h|sporadic], Blegg replied. [h|mostly crushed by human fighters bright enough to realize the AI rulers were better than any previous human ones].

he turned to another card, saw how they were laid out all around him like gravestones.

Skaidon, direct interfacing with the Craystein computer; dead and sainted while opening a whole new vista in physics. the first runcible test between Earth and Mars. that pioneer building going up on the shores of Lake Geneva. Blegg walking inside, into a place where it should have been impossible for any human to come, revealing himself to the entity called Earth Central, ruler of the solar system, ruler then of the near stars as the first runcible seed ships arrived, then of that fast expanding empire called the Polity.

now a huge ship formed in his view in the shape of a flattened pear, brassy in colour and bristling with antennae, weapons, spherical war drones pouring out of it like wasps from a nest recently whipped with a stick. A Polity dreadnought revolving slowly in space. once spherical, now fires burnt deep inside it, revealing massive impact sites.

[h|Prador], said Atheter.

[h|hostile from the first moment of contact. without the AIs on our side, they would have crushed us. their metals technology was way in advance of ours and their ships difficult to destroy  --  exotic-metal armour. but they did not have runcibles, for artificial minds are needed to control them. that gave us easy access to resources, the instantaneous repositioning of planetary forces. the card then showed some vast construct in space: a great claw, nil-g scaffolds groping out into blackness, ships and construction robots amassing all around.

[h|we never needed that], Blegg said nodding at the huge object. [h|it was one of a planned network of space-based runcibles for shifting large ships, even fleets, or for hurling moons at the Prador. they withdrew before then. we never realized until afterwards that their old king had been usurped. the Second Kingdom became the Third Kingdom, and the new ruler knew this was a fight he could not win].

[h|you are a cipher for your time].

[h|I guess], said Blegg. [h|but we are all ciphers for our times. it is just that my time has been a long one. you perhaps are the ultimate cipher, for the time of an entire race?].

the cards began sinking out of sight. the scape around him revolved like some great cog repositioning reality.

<e>you and me both, alice</e> , thought Blegg, closing his eyes until the nauseating sensation stopped.

[h|and now Jain technology].

Blegg opened his eyes. he stood now on a trampled layer of reedlike plants. beside him those plants still grew tall, greenish red, small flowers of white and red blooming from a matted tangle of sideshoots. in the aubergine sky hung the orb of a distant gas giant: green and red and gold. in a moment he realized something mountainous now squatted beside him. he turned and looked up at it.

[h|no], he murmured, [h|I don’t believe you].

something chuckled, low and deep.

using the disassembler, Orlandine removed a silica crystal no larger than a grain of talc. holding this between hundred-angstrom filaments, she conveyed it to a hollow memcrystal inside the disassembler head. such memcrystals were designed for analysis of quantum computers used to control human nanotechnology, so perhaps this might be enough. through nanotubes penetrating the memcrystal, she injected polarized carbon molecules into the hollow, where they underwent Van der Waals bonding. slowly and surely, connections began to be made. having already ascertained the connection points on the silica crystal to the sensory structures on the node’s surface, she became able to apply some logic to what she now received. the base code was quaternary, much like the earlier codes used in human quantum computing before they went multilevel synaptic, and was therefore disappointingly simple. Orlandine soon began to track the algorithms: this happens, check this, reach thus, check that, and so on. but a frightening, fascinating picture emerged.

everything was there to identify the touch of a living creature even prior to physical contact  --  by movement, heat, environment, organic components in the air, on the skin  --  but these all together did not stimulate into action the circuits that initiated the [h|stinging cells’, or signal deeper structures within the node. something more was required: the identification of information conveyed by electro-magnetic media, identification of industry-produced compounds in the air, regularity of structures in the immediate environment …. the list just kept growing, the deeper Orlandine delved. she saw that each of these could be the product of dumb beasts: social insects produced regular structures, any compound produced by industry could be produced in natural environments, and many lifeforms communicated by electromagnetic media. but it was through an assessment of the whole that the Jain nodes identified intelligent technological life.

<e>why?</e>.

the configuration of what she had thus far seen told her the node was a trap just waiting to be sprung. but what kind of trap required this level of technology?. she knew she ought to be frightened, but instead was fascinated and excited. To kill one sentient being you did not need all this. To kill many of them …. maybe?. no, it could not be as simple as that. abruptly, disparate thought streams all came together inside her organic and crystalline mind, and she made one of those intuitive leaps more associated with her organic side than with her silicon one, and understood the truth. this was a trap laid for the destruction of intelligent <e>species</e> , of entire <e>races</e> , the complex fantastic technology being both the bait and the teeth of it. she must learn how to take that bait without springing the trap.

now returning her attention to the node itself, she used the disassembler to begin stripping away those structures already mapped. very quickly she discovered the stinging cells were the leading ends of mycelial fibres consisting of bundles of buckytubes with guiding heads containing a mass of sensory gear. she realized that again she saw a technology already used in the Polity, for by using similar mycelial fibres an aug made connections inside the human brain. the mycelia in that case, however, were generated by the aug and guided by feedback  --  the aug changing the tension along each of the four nanotubes of each mycelium to change its direction of penetration. and the sensory heads sought out the particular electrical signatures generated by synapses. these structures, however, were very much more advanced. designed to incorporate the substance they penetrated, they carried complex bases for exterior silicon crystallization, so as the fibres extended themselves they intermittently grew processors along their length. the sensory heads were also hugely complex and obviously designed to seek out more than just synapses, or perhaps more than <e>human</e> synapses.

the more she worked the more Orlandine saw the sheer extent of the technology involved. the Polity used nanotechnology, and because of that she could easily recognize many of the structures she saw here. but it seemed all about the level of development. just because a race knew how to make bricks, concrete and steel did not necessarily mean it knew how to put them together to the best effect. having all the parts and knowing their potential did not mean you yourself could realize that potential. the Polity was building small houses, whereas whatever created this had made something capable of throwing up skyscrapers, <e>by itself</e> .

other nanomachines she discovered: things like viruses and bacteria capable of replicating for as yet unknown purposes; others that spread their own mycelial networks and created their own controlling processors; some almost prosaic pieces of nanotech that drilled, cut and plucked elementary atoms from compounds. then she found something that actually grew lasing materials, and understood these were for transmitting light signals down the buckytubes  --  optics. she tracked back to discover that the quantum processors could respond both electrically and photonically. not even just skyscrapers, she then realized: <e>cities</e> . she had uncovered less than five per cent of this node’s secrets, but even so reckoned she was delving into an entire technological <e>ecology</e> .
