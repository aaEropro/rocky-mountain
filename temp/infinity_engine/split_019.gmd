<e>Polity agents: such is the quantity of fiction produced about these characters that it is quite probable most people have no real idea of what they are at all. often portrayed as super beings who spend most of their time whacking Separatists, defeating dastardly Prador plots, stumbling on ancient alien ruins, or shagging their way through most of the population, it is sometimes difficult to remember that they are real people, with a seriously difficult job to do. such an agent, unless the circumstances are exceptional, is usually recruited from some elite force like the Sparkind, then trained even further. his remit is basically the same as the one the AIs voluntarily adhere to: the greatest good for the greatest number (though how this is assessed is open to debate). such an individual is bound by duty, has harsh self-discipline, and must make some hard choices. and what do they do?. well …. revisit my second sentence above</e>.

 --  from [h|how it is] by Gordon

the vague red area on the Dyson segment finally resolved to a single dot. Cormac could only assume the earlier blurring a problem with this new method of scanning, which was now finally solved. A further five dreadnoughts arrived along with ten more attack ships  --  including some of the new Centurions  --  to complement the search. the ones that had arrived earlier were moving into the targeted segment, but Cormac now contemplated withdrawing them. if this Legate entity used Jain technology, their chances of capturing it dropped to only a little above zero. the Legate, he suspected, knew how to utilize the same technology considerably better than the Separatist Thellant.

[h|other information has become available], announced Jack. [h|I am now reconfiguring the segment scanners].

abruptly it seemed to Cormac that he was falling towards the Dyson segment, then into it, through layers of composite, past titanic structural members to which fusion reactors clung like barnacles, and into its vast icy halls. something shimmered before him and, in flashes of pixellated colour, became visible. soon he gazed upon the Legate’s ship, as it cruised along a hundred yards above a frigid peneplain. cross-referencing this new data to the position of the Jain node they were still detecting, they confirmed it to be aboard this same ship.

[h|what is this?].

[h|the solution to that ship’s chameleonware], said a voice beside him.

he turned to Blegg, whose ship had docked with the <e>NEJ</e> only a little while ago. [h|and how did we get hold of that?].

[h|interesting question, to which at present I can provide no answer. however, the possibilities of our capturing this Legate have now increased substantially].

Cormac considered that statement, and what Thorn had said before departing to join one of the Centurion attack ships conducting the search. being an agent for some greater enemy, would the Legate destroy itself rather than be captured?.

[h|Jack, analysis of that ship], he enquired.

[h|A product of a Jain-based organic technology. it seems to be totally formatted for covert operations: sophisticated chameleonware, damped drive and thrusters. the hull is metallo-organic matrix  --  not heavily armoured but probably capable of rapid self-repair. To find out anything more about it would require active scan, which could be detected].

[h|that’s all I need to know, thanks]. Cormac eyed Blegg. [h|if we capture this creature, we’ll need to quarantine it, then somehow deactivate the tech it is using, then]  --  he shrugged  --  [h|interrogate it?].

Blegg just waited, inscrutably silent.

Cormac continued, [h|I think the preferable option would be to find out where it came from, because certainly it is not working alone …. Jack, I want weaknesses introduced into the blockade]. in his gridlink he selected the locations, and gave the precise parameters for each weakness. [h|out from <e>there</e> we lay EM mines. it won’t go for that one if it has any sense. now, move the <e>NEJ</e> over <e>here</e> ].

[h|what are you planning?]. Horace Blegg asked.

Cormac glanced at him, then said, [h|Jack  --  kill the hologram].

the internal scene from the Dyson segment disappeared. now they were standing on the glassy floor of the bridge.

Cormac considered his reply to Blegg for a long moment, then said, [h|we let the Legate go].

the Legate still did not understand. Skellor had been a success  --  a trial run providing information about how the Polity would respond to Jain attack for, after all, Erebus needed to know nothing more about Jain technology itself. admittedly the situation on Coloron had been hurried, since the Legate had intended to provide Thellant with a Jain node some years hence. and yes, Orlandine now seemed a dismal and worrying failure. but why so endanger a covert mission by sending the Legate here?. it made no sense.

as it relayed all the recent updates of events on Coloron from its probes and U-space transmitters, all around that planet, and then fully apprised Erebus of the situation here, the Legate expected to receive in return a self-destruction order. the attack ships searching the segment were all now closing in, and soon there would be little chance of escape. Orlandine, before cutting communication, had kindly informed the entity that she had provided ECS with the solution to this ship’s present chameleonware configuration. no time to change that configuration now. angry, it felt the urge to betray her presence here, if she had not already done so herself. however, though the Legate considered the experiment with her to be a failure, she might still damage the Polity.

[h|attempt to return], came the U-space reply from Erebus  --  a totally unexpected instruction.

switching from passive scanning to full power scanning, the Legate began analysing its situation. ECS did not possess enough ships to completely enclose this Dyson segment so there were obvious weaknesses in the blockade. the largest weakness the entity ignored completely, since that seemed an obvious trap. it chose another one and plotted a course accordingly. maximum acceleration from the segment would put it in range of one of the ECS attack ships for just a few seconds  --  enough time, however, for it to be destroyed. but few other options remained, so it engaged its ship’s fusion drive.

the spoon-shaped ship turned by a slanted joist, two bright flames ignited to its rear. accelerating, it left a cloud of icy fog behind it.

[h|would not self-destruction be better?]. the Legate enquired.

[h|is there no possibility of escape?].

[h|escape <e>is</e> possible].

[h|then you must return to me for reintegration. resources are not to be wasted. I refuse you permission to destroy yourself under any circumstances. try your utmost to shake pursuit, but ensure you return here].

clear as mud.

the Legate’s ship exceeded 20,000 miles an hour and continued accelerating. the entity itself estimated that seven seconds would take it far enough from the Dyson segment for it to be able to engage U-space drive. if it survived those seven seconds it would be clear. there might be pursuit but, once in U-space it could reconfigure its chameleonware, then after a few more such jumps no ECS ship would have a chance of following. ahead, a line of glowing orange revealed the segment’s edge. EM shells began to detonate all around, interfering with the ship’s systems. something blew right behind the Legate, filling the few gaps in the interior with metallic smoke; diagnostics went haywire and some of the ship’s computing ability crashed. however, the engines continued working uninterrupted, and the ship possessed sufficient redundancy to cover this. the orange line thickened; brighter towards the bottom and bluish above, with the occasional flecks of stars  --  or ships  --  becoming visible. then, within a moment, the little ship hurtled out into the open.

telefactors and drones filled nearby space. A modern Centurion-class attack ship lay close, and missiles streaked in from all sides. the Legate scanned those missiles: decoys mixed with rail-gun accelerated solid projectiles hurtled up from below; CTD and planar warheads came in from above and to the left; and EM shells and more rail-gun projectiles came from the right. the current attack appeared designed to drive it down and to the right, into dense gas, where it would necessarily take longer to drop into U-space. in an instant the Legate had created a defence to take it on through. the ship could survive rail-gun strikes so long as they hit nothing vital. the decoys and EM shells could be ignored. nothing else must get close.

it altered its course sharply to the right. EM shells ignited all around it, and rail-gun projectiles slammed into the ship. systems scrambled, fire exploded around the Legate, then vacuum sucked it away through punctures in the hull. diagnostics briefly online: five projectiles punched right through the ship  --  inert rail-gun projectiles that missed the ship’s drives, else the craft and Legate would be a spreading cloud of vapour by now. hull mesh and mycelial repair already working. the Legate glanced down to see part of its own thigh had been torn away, while jags of hot metal penetrated its chest. ignoring these injuries, it put its ship into a five-hundred gravity turn, downwards, then abruptly back up again. it targeted nearby missiles with lasers, but only two of the six weapons worked. A detonating CTD cleared a hole, and the Legate aimed for it. more impacts: sheet lightning of energy discharges throughout the ship, molten metal spattering the screen from the inside. then, utterly on the edge of disaster, the Legate dropped its vessel into U-space.

[h|A risky strategy], Blegg said.

Cormac shrugged as he gazed at the bridge display. [h|we would have gained very little by trying to capture that ship. the Legate would probably have destroyed itself rather than allow that. now at least we might learn something].

at that moment the bridge display blinked out, then came on again to show the grey roiling of U-space  --  or rather a human-tolerable simulacrum. feeling that familiar shift into the ineffable, Cormac nodded to himself in satisfaction. he turned to where Jack had thoughtfully provided two reclining chairs and a coffee table, now sitting incongruously at the centre of the black glass floor. he noted that one of those dracomen saddle seats had also appeared. evidently Scar would be joining them. Cormac walked over and plumped himself down in a recliner.

[h|okay], he said. [h|you still tracking it, Jack?].

[h|I am], replied the ship’s AI.

[h|we have three other state-of-the-art Centurions like the <e>NEJ</e> ], he explained to Blegg as the Oriental joined him. [h|they all possess the new chameleonware].

[h|yes]. grudgingly said.

Cormac stared at Blegg for a long moment. there now seemed something different about him, something wrong. he did not ask about this, because he knew his chances of receiving a straight answer were minimal. instead he said, [h|Jack, all the older ships are to deny themselves the ability to track the signature of a Jain node. they’ll probably lose sight of the Legate’s ship after the first two or three jumps. you, and the other three Centurions, start using your ’ware right now. you’ll relay our coordinates to the other ships, whenever possible, but they are to stand off meanwhile unless we call them in].

[h|you are supposing it will run for home], suggested Blegg.

[h|I am, yes, but if it doesn’t and looks set to approach any Polity worlds or bases, we’ll then attempt capture. I think it will run for home, and I can only --]

[h|something has occurred], Jack interrupted.

the bridge display changed, and once again they gazed upon the Dyson segment hanging in the clouds from the demolished gas giant. Cormac realized he now viewed a recording from one of the dreadnoughts, for he could see the shape of the <e>NEJ</e> much closer to the segment itself. he watched the Legate’s escape, the storm of explosions, and the subsequent winking out of the Legate’s ship, then the <e>NEJ</e> and other ships as they dropped into U-space. the dreadnought held station, and its view closed in on the opposite side of the Dyson segment, where something flashed away at high speed and then also winked out. the view froze, reversed, then a frame enclosed a fusion drive flame and the object it propelled. selecting that image out, it magnified it for them. programs rapidly cleaned up the image.

[h|the <e>Heliotrope</e> ], said Jack.

[h|so she <e>was</e> hiding there], said Blegg.

Cormac grimaced. [h|Overseer Orlandine]. he added, [h|I suppose the question we should have been asking was why did the Legate come here?].

[h|and the answer?]. asked Blegg.

Cormac shook his head, then asked Jack, [h|did the <e>Heliotrope</e> escape completely?].

[h|it did], the AI replied. [h|only two dreadnoughts remained by the segment, but the <e>Heliotrope</e> did not fall within range of their weapons, even if they had chosen to use them].

A few facts came together in Cormac’s mind, and he turned to Blegg. [h|she sent us the solution to the Legate’s chameleonware so we would concentrate on that ship, thus giving her the opportunity to escape].

[h|outstanding reasoning], said Blegg.

[h|outstanding sarcasm], Cormac replied. [h|but we should have known].

[h|the information came via the AI net], Blegg replied. [h|an HK program tracked it only as far as one of the Cassius stations, from where it was broadcast to us. no real way of knowing if she sent it. do you want to go back?].

Orlandine was a haiman, who had been promoted to become overseer of a project this size, a murderer, and one quite likely to have had contact with this Legate. yet she had betrayed the Legate to them, and there had been only one node signature detected  --  the one aboard the Legate’s ship  --  hadn’t there?. Cormac felt a momentary disquiet, remembering how long it had taken to clean up that signature. maybe as long as it took a second node to follow through its program with a host and therefore cease to be detectable as a node?. this woman could be someone even more dangerous than Skellor. but an AI had once told Cormac that psychos wielding weapons, however dangerous, should not be your prime target: you should always go after the arms trade that supplied them.

[h|continue the pursuit], he directed.

settled in a storage area and perpetually updated by Jack, Arach wondered if he had made a big mistake. space battles, he felt, were okay if there was some chance that enemy ships might need to be boarded, but there had been no need of that. long pursuits through space were also okay, so long as there might then ensue a planetfall and some subsequent ground-based conflict. but was that likely?. for a long time Arach had been shutting himself down for periods that extended over decades. signing on to <e>Celedon</e> , the station drawing the line of Polity, he had hoped to find some action there. no such luck. this hooking up with a Polity agent known to often get involved in violent conflicts was the drone’s last desperate gamble at relieving boredom. if this did not work, then maybe permanent shutdown?. or perhaps Arach should abandon the Polity altogether and see if he could find some action beyond the line?. he would wait and see. in darkness he drew power to charge up his energy reserves, counted and recounted his esoteric collection of missiles, and ran perpetual diagnostic checks on his weapons systems. he would see.

in U-space the ship repaired itself and within two weeks, ship time, regained optimum function. some debris still lay around inside it  --  pieces of rail-gun missiles and burnt-out components  --  but, given time, the ship’s mycelium would take these apart and incorporate them. the Legate watched nearby disturbances in the continuum, caused by the pursuing warships, and now began to work on plans for evading them. they knew the solution to this vessel’s chameleonware, thanks to Orlandine, so time to do something about that. the Legate ran programs to completely change how that ’ware operated, created back-up programs for further changes, then, finally ready, it surfaced its ship back into the real.

seven ships materialized a mere 100,000 miles away in interstellar space: two dreadnoughts and five old-style attack ships. the Legate instantly onlined the new program and accelerated for some distance under conventional drive, before dropping back into underspace, the ’ware distorting its U-signature too, and concealing the ship in underspace. the Legate travelled for five days in that continuum, and still detected some disturbance in the vicinity, which meant the ships could still detect it, or had chosen a close course by chance. again into the real.

this time the two dreadnoughts were gone and only three of the attack ships remained. the Legate jumped again, then again before changing the ’ware program for a second time. some kind of feedback through the program created ghost distortions during the transition from one continuum to another, but this time no pursuers remained. as a precaution the Legate changed the program yet again, and made three more random jumps, before setting a course of jumps for home. still some ghosting in the system, but considering how close it had come to destruction, the Legate could live with that.

during initial contact, the pseudopods within the manacle withdrew from sight, but the humanoid dragon head remained, its neck sinking out of view, bringing the head to rest in the layer of flesh, like a man sinking in living quicksand and tilting his head back for one final breath. its expression grew slack and unresponsive, as if something had pulled a plug below. during the ensuing hours the entity’s surrounding liverlike flesh hardened and scales rose out of it, like flakes of skin about to break away but then petrifying to gemlike solidity  --  crystallizing and growing translucent. further hours passed.

at last something was happening. observing the magnified section of the linkage between the two dragon spheres, Mika noticed pseudopods detaching from each other and withdrawing. the bright sunlight that previously shone down on the manacle building for twenty minutes of every hour, as the two spheres revolved around each other in the sun’s orbit, was briefly occluded by a titanic pseudopod tree breaking away from the main connection, its fans opening out then folding in vacuum as it retreated into the other sphere. Mika felt the floor shift and observed the draconic landscape rolling all about in fleshy waves. then the connection between the two spheres really began to come apart. shucked off scales rained through space at the parting and even the occasional dead pseudopod. the whole connection unravelled like the severing of some vast fibre-optic skein, through which a sapphire light passed.

[h|discussion over, I see; so you convinced your brother sphere?]. she nervously glanced down at the head, expecting it to re-engage with her at this point, or at least for Dragon to give her some response over the comsystem. none was forthcoming, and it worried her that Dragon could not spare the processing power for a simple communication. then that changed, as the head jerked out of its torpor and opened its eyes, like a corpse reanimated and prophesying doom.

[h|run to your ship], it said, [h|you cannot survive here].

surfacing after yet another U-space jump, Jack surveyed the planetary system ahead, cataloguing individual planets and scanning for large artificial constructions either on them or in surrounding space. Two light months ahead, the AI picked up some signs of battle: weapons] flashes with the familiar signature of CTDs and plain atomics, a UV flash followed incrementally by infrared, pinpricks of coherent microwave radiation probably the result of masers firing. the immediacy of U-space signatures was not evident now, since this conflict of course took place two months ago. scanning did not sufficiently reveal the combatants, though there seemed many low albedo objects in the system at the time. the AI assumed the Legate had surfaced into the real here just to view this scene. grabbing the opportunity, Jack sent off a U-space information package detailing their present coordinates and events thus far. A return package updated him on the position of a steadily growing fleet of ECS dreadnoughts, a light century behind them.

[h|are we strolling into an interstellar war?]. wondered Blegg.

listening in to the conversation, Jack wondered if they might be bringing one along with them.

[h|there’s always that possibility], Cormac replied as he stepped out into the training area, [h|but why go pissing off the Polity if you’re already involved in such a serious conflict?].

[h|historically speaking, such actions from aggressors have not been unusual].

[h|and you would know, wouldn’t you?]. Cormac muttered sarcastically.

through internal cameras, Jack observed Blegg and Cormac squaring off to each other once again, and relayed this image to the other ships. the contests fought between the Sparkind throughout this journey were interesting, but this one would be even more so. Jack supposed the two contestants were hardly aware of the betting going on between AIs behind the scenes, just as they seemed unaware that while they fought, they sometimes moved at AI speeds. of course, since recent revelations to him, Blegg’s mood swayed between indifference and anger, so the results of the contests became less easy to predict. then, just as the two agents exchanged their first blows, all four ships dropped into U-space.

many hours later, ship time, the four resurfaced within the system. the Legate’s ship surfaced too, only briefly, then continued on. Jack once again scanned, but found little more than gaseous clouds and small masses of debris from the distantly viewed conflict here. but there was no time to grab any for analysis.

[h|it’s not stopping here], observed the AI of the <e>Haruspex</e> .

[h|there is nothing to stop for, since obviously this is no base], the <e>Coriolanus</e> AI interjected.

[h|map and track], instructed Jack, dropping into underspace yet again.

in the underlying continuum they compared figures, and traced the course of the Legate’s ship on its way out of the system.

[h|the high-albedo object  --  it is heading there], said Haruspex.

[h|nova or accretion disc?]. wondered the <e>Belisarius</e> AI.

[h|not a nova], said Jack, studying previous images. [h|either an accretion disc or a sun being eaten by a black hole  --  though, if the latter, I would have expected more X-ray radiation].

during their next jump through U-space Jack analysed data gathered from the system they had departed. Two living worlds there  --  one wintry and the other hot and humid. the battle seemed to have centred around the hot world and, checking recorded images, Jack saw evidence of some sort of impact on its surface  --  something worth checking further should the opportunity arise.

the rest of the planetary system consisted of, further out, a huge gas giant twice the size of Jupiter, a scattering of icy planetoids and asteroids, and one giant frigid world with its own ring system, and a rather odd and low reflective and highly metallic planetoid between the orbits of those two giants. this thing, being small, did not possess sufficient gravity to keep its surface flat, lacked atmosphere and therefore weather to erode down its features, yet it occupied an area swarming with spaceborne detritus so should be pocked with craters. the image Jack viewed showed something smooth as marble. it must be a recent addition to this solar system  --  a not uncommon occurrence considering the vast number of dark worlds roaming the space between suns.

Thorn bowed to his opponent  --  a man stripped to the waist, exposing a physique that seemed as if forged from iron, the effect redoubled by his skin bearing a metallic tint  --  then snatched his head back from the path of a foot arcing towards it. back-fisting the foot along its course, he kicked out for the back of his opponent’s other knee, then withdrew the strike as the attacking foot snapped back towards him. Chalter grinned at him, blinking pinkish albino eyes that were another result of whatever adaptation gave his skin that metallic hue. the man was disconcertingly good, but then Thorn expected no less: all of the soldiers aboard the <e>Haruspex</e> were Sparkind. Chalter now tried bringing his foot down on Thorn’s forward-bent knee, while simultaneously aiming a chop to the side of his head. Thorn withdrew swiftly, not wanting another session with the autodoc, as after his last encounter with Chalter. he spun into a roundhouse kick, just skimming Chalter’s face, followed that with a chop that put the man off-balance, then hammered a blur of punches into his torso. of course, punching Chalter’s torso seemed about as effective as thumping wood. the blows threw the man back, knocked a little breath out of him, but he grinned and instantly came in to attack again.

such was the way Thorn relieved his boredom. on board a month passed before the alien vessel headed out-Polity, and now they had been pursuing it for two months altogether. if he had known it would go on for so long he would have climbed into a coldsleep coffin for the duration. he considered doing so now but, for all they knew the Legate’s eventual destination might be only minutes away. but at least Thorn was enjoying more amenable company aboard this high-tech Centurion, the <e>Haruspex</e> , than did Cormac aboard the <e>NEJ</e> . for travelling with Horace Blegg and the dracomen would not be a bundle of laughs.

there were four Sparkind units in all aboard the <e>Haruspex</e> , each of them consisting of four individuals  --  two Golem and two human, so always there would at least be a card game Thorn could join, or a training session in VR or for real like this.

finally, having worked up a good sweat and noting from the scoreboard projected overhead that the <e>Haruspex</e> AI placed them at about even, Thorn called a halt. as they drew apart, on the raised platform circling the chamber above them, a couple of Sparkind clapped with slow sarcasm before heading down to take their turn. Thorn eyed them: a woman called Sheerna and a Golem called Aspex. he knew Sheerna was keen to perfect some techniques against an opponent who simply did not make mistakes.

[h|same time tomorrow?]. Chalter enquired.

[h|supposing nothing more interesting comes up, yes], Thorn replied.

they collected their towels and, both mopping sweat from their faces, moved out into a corridor leading to the crew quarters.

[h|I’m told that if this latest destination doesn’t turn out to be the target, <e>Belisarius</e> is going to use a gravtech weapon to knock the Legate’s ship out of U-space], Chalter commented.

[h|who told you that?].

[h|One of the guys aboard the <e>Coriolanus</e> , called Bhutan. he tells me even the AIs are getting rather bored and tetchy].

that did not entirely surprise Thorn. A month in human terms probably felt to an AI, whose mind operated at orders of magnitude faster, like a hundred years. however, merely being bored and tetchy could not justify such a change in the mission plan. he glanced questioningly at Chalter, for the man should know that.

[h|I think it’s due mostly to the direction and distance travelled], Chalter added. [h|they are starting to wonder if this Legate has realized it is still being pursued, and is now leading us away from its base. it might do that if it had no regard for time, or for its own life].

[h|what about that battle back there?]. Thorn asked.

Chalter nodded. [h|another reason for not continuing too much further. the AIs are keen to check out that planetary system].

[h|and I would guess], Thorn said, [h|that ships like this would be much better off guarding the Polity from its enemies. it would be advantageous for an enemy to expend just one small vessel in order to lead away four diamond-state ships like ours?].

[h|that’s the thinking], Chalter replied.

in his room Thorn was luxuriating in a shower when he felt the <e>Haruspex</e> depart U-space. he dried himself quickly and pulled on some Sparkind fatigues.

[h|Haruspex, that seemed a short jump, so what’s happening?]. he asked.

in a lazily superior tone the AI replied, [h|perhaps a question better directed <e>towards</e> the Legate. I have no idea why he surfaced here].

[h|could we be getting closer to his destination?].

[h|not yet ascertained].

as he stepped outside his quarters, Thorn again felt that strange twisting, and knew they had submerged yet again. the ensuing jump was also of short duration, for Thorn had taken only a few paces along the corridor before the ship surfaced again. distantly, he heard machinery winding up to speed, and clanking sounds against the hull.

[h|we are under attack], Haruspex noted.

Thorn ran for the ship’s bridge, Chalter and the other three unit leaders joining him soon after. the <e>Haruspex</e> bridge was similar to that of the <e>NEJ</e> : a wide expanse of floor seemingly resting out in vacuum. Thorn discerned a distant vessel, and small objects swarming through space, close all around. To his far right he could see the <e>Coriolanus</e> , its laser strobing the cloud surrounding it. as the ranking officer aboard <e>Haruspex</e> , Thorn occupied one of the acceleration chairs available and leant back. Chalter and the others stood back, remaining out of the way, as it would not do to have too many people involved in this. images of other chairs began to blink into existence: the human commander of the Sparkind aboard <e>Coriolanus</e> , and Cormac aboard the <e>NEJ</e> . there were no humans present from the <e>Belisarius</e> , though a hologram of the ship’s avatar  --  a large chesspiece knight  --  did flicker into existence. Jack the hangman also appeared, along with Coriolanus the Roman legionary leaning on his spear, and Haruspex itself appearing as a floating crystal ball. all projection.

[h|it seems the Legate has just led us into some kind of set defence], Cormac observed.

<e>no shit</e> , thought Thorn as he observed a pumpkin-seed object go hurtling past propelled by a bright fusion flame, then tracked by laser and turned to vapour.

[h|why are we visible?]. he asked.

Cormac held up a hand and turned towards the legionary image. [h|you’ve received five hits, what’s your current situation?].

[h|they are not explosive, rather Jain subversion tech which, given time, would have completely subsumed this ship. I have destroyed them: three from outside by laser, the other two from the inside with a particle cannon].

[h|you see], added the human from the <e>Coriolanus</e>  --  Bhutan, a thin individual with pallid hairless skin and eyes like razor shards, who sported twinned military augs, one on each side of his head  --  [h|we flew straight into them, so chameleonware was no defence]. he glanced at Thorn. [h|there are so many of the damned things, we have to use proximity lasers, and the resulting weapons drain negates the ’ware effect].

Thorn had not known that fact. [h|the alien vessel?]. he asked.

Cormac replied, [h|completely ignored, and flying right through them].

[h|has it seen <e>us</e> ?]. Thorn asked.

Cormac glanced at him, then back towards whatever display he observed aboard the <e>NEJ</e> . [h|I think that highly likely], he shrugged, [h|so we’ll have to grab it and see what we can learn. I think that what we’ll learn, if anything at all, is that we are very close to its final destination].

[h|could this be it?]. wondered Haruspex.

in space, through the transparent walls of the <e>Haruspex</e> ’s bridge, the AI used a frame to pick out a small area and magnify it, revealing a distant object like some jungle ruin, still swamped in lianas, transported out into vacuum. like wasps issuing from their nests, the seed objects were swarming out of large barnacle-shaped excrescences on its surface.

Bhutan remarked, [h|looks like something completely subsumed].

[h|it looks like something that will cease to exist in about thirty seconds], Cormac added.

that brought about a silence as they all watched. perfectly on time, it seemed a pinhole punched through the strange object as if it were drawn on a sheet of black paper held up to the sun. abruptly it distorted and shrank inwards towards the hole. the view then polarized over some titanic flash, and next they observed an expanding sphere of glowing gas. within minutes the Centurions penetrated this, sang to the tune of the shockwave as it peeled their smaller attackers away from them.

[h|alien vessel is jumping], Belisarius  --  a horse head talking.

the scene greyed out for a few seconds, and around Thorn the holograms grew thin as a nightmare crowd. then the <e>Haruspex</e> shuddered back into the real, with star patterns altered about it.

[h|it’s still running in a straight line directly for that high-albedo object], Jack observed. [h|I would guess, upon observing us, it paused to receive instructions].

Thorn sighed and began to unstrap himself.

[h|but should we pursue any further], asked a new voice, [h|as we now know where to look?. should we not now call in the dreadnoughts?. that our quarry is continuing along its original course might indicate that whatever awaits at its destination is not too worried about us].

Thorn eyed the ancient Japanese man. he had a point: why risk four Centurions against an unknown foe?.

[h|but do we know where to look?]. Cormac asked. [h|this could merely be diversionary, and I’m not happy about bringing the larger force all the way out here until some target is confirmed]. he gazed at Blegg. [h|unless I am instructed otherwise, we continue].

Blegg shrugged resignedly and disappeared.

utterly connected and at one with the <e>Heliotrope</e> , as it rose from U-space into the real, Orlandine felt an amusement almost sublime. her dreams provided her with clues, and her partial interfacing with Jain technology provided the means. now she could detect a node signature in U-space. in those first moments of abrupt mental growth she assigned programs to the task and, on abandoning the Dyson segment, decided to track down other Jain nodes. and look where that search brought her: full circle.

she identified the four Centurion-class attack ships, way in front of her, only when the trap revealed them, though she had been aware of something in that location, for a node signature registered from there. she then surmised that the other node signature far ahead of them issued from the alien vessel. it further occurred to her that the Polity ships might be using the same tracking methods as herself, which was probably why they did not lose the ship despite its chameleonware being as sophisticated as their own.

<e>but what now?</e>.

she had decided to track down node signatures in the hope of observing uncontrolled Jain growth, to learn more and perhaps locate their original source. but pursuing these two could soon become a lethal occupation. her most sensible move would be to abandon the idea, and flee to somewhere remote where material and energy resources would be easily available to her. A planet was out of the question, for she was still not prepared to take the risk of putting herself in so vulnerable a position at the bottom of a gravity well. perhaps an asteroid or comet close to a sun …. but, even while considering those options, she kept the <e>Heliotrope</e> on the trail of the Polity ships, who in turn might well be following the alien vessel to its home.

there were no disagreements from the AIs about continuing this quest, but that was not unexpected as warship AIs tended not to back down. Cormac felt Blegg’s point only valid so far. whatever lay ahead might be something small they could easily neutralize. it might be very mobile, in which case halting now would defeat the whole reason for allowing the Legate to escape since, while they awaited the larger force, the Legate and whoever or whatever had sent it might escape. and if the Legate’s master turned out to be something too large for them to handle, then they could run, and only thereafter would it be time to pull in the dreadnoughts and destroyers.

Cormac returned from the bridge to his cabin, and lying on his bunk, worked through in his gridlink all the recordings of recent events. Jack informed him that the large object the <e>NEJ</e> had destroyed with a CTD imploder was once an old Polity ship called the <e>Calydonian Boar</e> . apparently it had joined up with some other AIs that headed out this way after the Prador War. this suggested those AIs either ran into something utilizing Jain technology or alternatively tech arising from it. or had used it themselves. the positioning of such a defence implied something to defend, which somewhat undermined his theory about a mobile opponent. he sighed and banished speculation  --  however it ran, they would achieve their aim here: not to engage and defeat some enemy, but to clearly identify one. it seemed they would know shortly to whom the Maker had handed over its Jain nodes.

he turned his thoughts to other matters. the memory package still awaited his attention, and yet again he began to consider the implications of that. he had once managed to translate himself through U-space, and though he could not see how that might be possible, it seemed nevertheless a damned useful ability to possess. he really needed to re-integrate those memories, to see if he could re-acquire that ability. however, he remained reluctant to venture into that hell, those memories integral to what Skellor made him suffer. other thoughts impinged: that he could translate himself through U-space might imply that Blegg, who claimed to be able to do the same, might be telling the truth after all, so was not merely some avatar of Earth Central. perhaps they were both that mythical thing so beloved of holofiction producers: [h|the post-human’. Cormac grunted in annoyance, dismissing the idea. the reality, he felt sure, was that the AIs were the genuine post-humans.

he decided the package would have to wait until after the resolution of forthcoming events out here. absorbing it now might psychologically damage him  --  impair his efficiency  --  and, until Blegg told him otherwise, he remained in charge and could not afford to risk that. he slid his feet off the bed and perched on the edge. he desperately needed something to do, and like the humans aboard the other ships, he headed for the ship’s training area.
