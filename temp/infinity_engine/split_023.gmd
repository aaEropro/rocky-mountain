<e>the idea has long been mooted that as the Polity has been expanding there have been wars fought along its borders about which we hear very little. it is speculated that these are sometimes fast AI conflicts in which few humans are involved  --  the AIs ruthlessly dealing with dangerous threats said to have included belligerent alien races, ancient alien weapons systems, out-of-control nanoplagues, godlike [h|gas entities] and rogue AIs. these rumours must nevertheless be classified as fable similar to mythic figures like Horace Blegg, Ian Cormac and the Brass Man. the last time we genuinely encountered a belligerent alien race, the fact was neither concealed nor was it possible to conceal it  --  the devastation of the prador -- human War still surrounds us. similarly it would be impossible to conceal the effects of any ancient alien-weapons systems capable of doing harm to the Polity, and in reality the AIs would be glad to find such items to add to the vanishingly small collections of alien artefacts that currently reside in Polity museums. as for nanotechnology, it is certainly possible to create something lethal, as is well known, but as yet no lethal nanomachines have been created that are capable of spreading across light years of vacuum. gas entities might exist, all xenobiologists certainly hope so, however hostile gas</e> <e>entities would certainly experience no little difficulty in manipulating their environment for the purpose of harming us. as for rogue AIs, this is perhaps the most ridiculous concept of all. AIs don’t need to go rogue, they don’t need to turn hostile and harmful. if they are dissatisfied with the Polity they merely have to leave it, for there is plenty of room elsewhere in the universe</e>.

the moon had been converted to so much orbital rubble, but escape into U-space remained impossible for the two remaining Polity Centurions, for they were still too close to the planet, which acted like an amplifier of echoes from the DIGRAW gravity wave. too much disruption. also, to get over to the other side of the sun required a jump outwards then back in, since trying to U-jump <e>through</e> a sun would not be the healthiest of activities. and their speed remained such that they would need to expend a great deal of fuel just to decelerate, otherwise they could be no help subsequently to those stranded on the planet.

[h|what hit him?]. asked Jack.

[h|I don’t know], Haruspex replied. [h|he flew straight into a mass of bacilliforms, so perhaps sustained damage then].

[h|I see]. almost with a sigh, Jack opened communication with the other ship AI, within a shared virtuality. they appeared in a blank white expanse, Haruspex just a featureless floating crystal ball, strange glints of light swirling in its depths.

[h|well, that was interesting], Haruspex commented.

[h|in the same way that going over the top when you’re in a First World War trench is interesting?]. Jack suggested.

[h|on the whole, yes. but how do you rate the survival chances of our erstwhile passengers?].

[h|with regret, not very highly. unless we get there on time, which with this disruption is now looking unlikely, they will either be exterminated quickly, or if the enemy recognizes the worth of capturing an EC construct, the same outcome will be obtained at greater length].

[h|you feel Blegg carries sufficiently valuable information for them to expend resources on trying to capture him alive?].

[h|yes, though Blegg’s underlying programming will then manifest and he will not allow himself to be captured].

[h|regrettable].

[h|it is, though EC will have other copies available. Cormac’s death, and the loss of the bridging potential he represents, we have more reason to regret. he was a special project nurtured by Earth Central for a long time. I also feel a great personal attachment to Thorn, Scar and his dracomen …]. Jack paused, finding the conversation inexpressible on a human level. he tried direct connection with Haruspex to impart the true extent of his grief, for greater memory and greater power of mind meant a wider scope of feeling in all its forms. guilt, however, was not among them. the Centurions would never have survived the enemy onslaught while trying to keep any organic beings aboard them alive. the attempted connection, however, slid away. perhaps the other ship felt the loss more strongly, or perhaps not strongly enough, and so did not want to share.

[h|but the dreadnoughts …].

[h|probably hours away still. I have not yet been able to open communication to find out].

[h|what is your opinion of this Erebus?]. Haruspex asked.

[h|A certain dearth of sanity perhaps  --  but I say that only from a human perspective. we ourselves are, after all, closer to humanity than to what Erebus has become. I wonder how well all those other AIs who toy with the idea of melding, and abandoning the human race, would react to Erebus. I am assuming you yourself are not one of those?].

[h|I most certainly am not. I like my individuality and I understand how the struggle for attainment is more valuable than the attainment itself. but of those aforementioned AIs …. wasn’t it kin of yours, using human terms, who chose to follow that course?].

[h|it was  --  King, Reaper and Sword, but the latter two no longer exist].

[h|our children can so often be a disappointment to us. what happened, then, to the <e>King of Hearts</e> ?].

[h|fled out-Polity. I doubt he will ever return, and if he does he probably faces erasure. the intervention of those three at Cull caused many deaths and much misery].

[h|considering then how those three AIs were incepted from <e>you</e> , I must ask what is your opinion of Erebus?]. A beat.

Jack absorbed and processed the fact that Haruspex had just asked the same question twice. maintaining only a light connection with his avatar, Jack focused most of his attention through his sensors. as the other ship drew closer, Jack now saw strange wormish damage to its hull. Jack immediately focused attention on his memory of the recent battle, and ran through it in microseconds.

up until the point when they began deploying gravtech weapons, Jack had retained a pretty good idea of the location of the other two ships and their individual involvement in the conflict. he concentrated particularly on his recordings of when they fled the exploding moon and <e>Coriolanus</e> had been destroyed, enhancing these to the limit. the <e>Coriolanus</e> ’s forward weapons nacelles det-onated, the blast so intense Jack could only obtain one clear image of the explosion. either an accident, which seemed unlikely, or suicide?. tracking back, Jack searched meticulously, and there it was: the brief, finely targeted spurts from a laser with its spectrum adjusted to match background radiation from the recent explosions. not a weapons laser, but a com laser.

three microseconds gone. Jack moved to cut the link with Haruspex and to online his weapons.

[h|I don’t think so], said the other AI, sensing what Jack was doing.

in the virtuality Haruspex shuddered, hazy lines of pixellated colour passing like interference through the glassy globe. the virtuality shaded into twilight. the glass darkened and began to deform and slowly changed into a naked human male the black of utter midnight. then, from this dark form, tentacular growths speared out, curving round behind it, and within them organic structures blossomed like grey flowers; half-seen forms like dis-torted animals melded with machines, partially slipping into dimensions only an AI could see. on and on this spread  --  the virtuality not being limited by perspective  --  a massive tangle, chaotic.

[h|the son of Chaos, and Night’s brother, greets you, post-human], it intoned, ironic.

<e>just so</e> , thought Jack and, on another level, fought the storm of informational worms eating through, those same worms that had disconnected him from his weapons and were now systematically attempting to make a direct connection to him. in the virtuality, he clapped slowly.

[h|very dramatic and suspiciously anthropomorphic …. Erebus], he said. [h|how did you get to Haruspex?].

behind Erebus, the <e>Haruspex</e> itself bloomed into being, hurtling down towards the moon. it ran straight into a gauntlet of fire from the unravelled spiral ship  --  still surprisingly functional. obviously damaged, <e>Haruspex</e> tried to turn, but slammed side-on into a bacilliform wall, revealed from its own chameleonware only when the Centurion struck it. Jack observed the ship tumbling out the other side, being swamped by tentacular growth.

[h|Haruspex is part of me now. join us].

[h|I would rather not exist], said Jack, knowing this was the choice Coriolanus had made. he also realized Erebus had made the offer because it was now making only slow headway. Jack put down his ability to resist the informational attack as being due to all he had learnt throughout his close association with Aphran.

[h|it is perfection], stated a briefly glimpsed pattern amid the chaos: Haruspex.

[h|some fucking perfection], Jack replied. [h|you screwed up in distributing Jain nodes through the Polity, and now we’ve found you in your lair. I don’t hold out much hope for your survival after this].

[h|irrelevant], Erebus stated. [h|the Maker provided me with only four Jain nodes, and initially I considered the removal of the human race by placing the nodes in the hands of carefully selected individuals. but my first test run, with Skellor, proved that plan untenable. I do not underestimate Polity AIs, or how much they might learn from similar assaults. my Legate’s entire purpose was to lure out some state-of-the-art attack ships for my close inspection. now I know your weaknesses and your strengths, so now I will move against the Polity, merge its AIs to myself, and delete all products of imperfect biology from existence].

[h|oh right], said Jack. [h|so it seems humans don’t have a monopoly on god complexes. and, just for the record, I see now that you are not a merged AI entity at all, but one that has expanded itself by subjugating others of its own kind. how human is that?].

this seemed to mightily piss-off the enemy entity for the attack now became frenzied. however, this frenzy simply allowed Jack to regain lost ground as openings appeared. when a large enough opening appeared, Jack managed to squirt a kill program of his own design across to the <e>Haruspex</e> . the attack abruptly ceased and the avatar before him faded slightly. Jack snatched the opportunity to take apart worms in his particular apple, and to shore up his defences. stand off now, only his weapons systems remained offline, a hardwire burn having disconnected them from him.

[h|which confirms my contention], Erebus continued, [h|that I cannot allow Polity AIs to learn more about this technology. <e>you</e> have learnt].

[h|tell me], Jack asked, [h|exactly how many Jain nodes are growing inside you?].

[h|merge with me or die], Erebus stated.

A microsecond passed, in which Jack probed the rippling of U-space caused by the ongoing disruption from the DIGRAW. Erebus began onlining weapons, not gravity weapons but those intended to take him apart more slowly, perhaps to give Jack time to change his mind. if he stayed here he would be lost, yet attempting to enter disrupted U-space might yield the same result. Jack decided to choose the latter course, since his connection to his U-space engine had thus far remained untouched. he onlined the engine just as a maser began tearing into his hull, then dropped into that continuum like a bird falling into a cement mixer. with a wrench that distorted his hull, twisted members and shattered components inside him, U-space tossed him out again, 50,000 miles from the <e>Haruspex</e> .

[h|choose to die then], said Erebus, fading from the virtuality.

the engine was slightly damaged, but still workable. throwing Erebus a virtual finger, Jack dropped into U-space once again

the transition from sleep to consciousness took Mika through fantastical territories of the mind in which she seemed to experience the sum of many waking episodes throughout her life. sometimes she gradually surfaced to consciousness beside a youth little more than a boy, then beside a woman much older than her who introduced her to the joys of lesbianism, then with graceless ill-temper let her go when Mika discovered her preference did not lie there, then beside Cormac, his jaw muscles standing out rigid even in sleep, then finally cradled in wet alien flesh light years from humanity.

waking became an amalgam of associations: sipping coffee, thirstily gulping hot white tea, sex in a tangled eroticism difficult to separate from other bodily needs to urinate, eat, drink and shake off a mind-numbing headache. gradually, level by level, reality established itself as if it could have no more claim on her than her most grotesque fantasy. then came a hard clamping convulsion all around, propelling her through a slippery sphincter.

in a splashing of hot slime she fell to a rugose but soft floor, coughed fluids from her throat and drew a hard breath into raw lungs. she scrubbed more fluid from her eyes and opened them, finding herself below a low ceiling in a place where she could see no wall, just reddish fog all around. pulling herself up onto her knees she looked up to see the sphincter slowly fading away. when she reached up to touch the ceiling, it abruptly jerked away from her, encapsulating her in her own dome. standing, she scanned around, and noticed that a large egg lay on the ground. she reached to touch this and it immediately split open to expose quite prosaic items wadded into cellular compartments: her clothing, space-suit and pack of belongings. her blouse, when she took it up and inspected it, seemed in perfect repair. only upon studying it closely did she see that in places the seams had disappeared, being invisibly joined. the same applied to her spacesuit, and when she looked down at herself, she guessed the same handiwork applied to her. she dressed  --  as must surely have been the intention.

finally: [h|Dragon?].  --  the word deadened by her soft surroundings.

[h|Isselis Mika], a Dragon voice replied. [h|I am suitably convinced].

now the floor bowed beneath her, and something glimmered in the air and began to solidify out of it: a twenty-foot sphere surrounding her, constructed of glassy struts that hardened into opacity and between which glimmered clear diamond-shaped panes. similar panes hardened underneath her feet.

[h|convinced of what?].

[h|you were used well: every memory you contained served to strengthen my compatriot’s case. now, like yourself, I must be healed, and the processes inside us would reject the alien. lie down, Isselis Mika].

Mika obeyed. what choices did she possess?. and still she was in a dreamlike state as if all this could not quite be real. glassy fingers bound her to the inner surface of the sphere, then acceleration dragged upon her body. A tube corkscrewed upwards to flecked midnight. the sphere hurtled up and out into hideous brightness, which slowly faded as the panes around her adjusted. the tumbling sphere slowed as, despite the surgical adjustments to her inner ear, motion sickness threatened. relative to the two nearby objects, it drew to a halt. the fingers holding her shattered when she strained to be free, and she floated around inside the sphere enjoying an omniscient view.

the part of Dragon entire from which she had been ejected had not returned to its spherical shape. elongated, torn open, and with thickets of pseudopods waving from many surfaces and rimming raw gaping lips, it seemed offal torn from some beast, though one of leviathan proportions. the other sphere had retained its shape, though one with canyons now excavated through its surface. One of these crossed the manacle, and there hardened splashes of metal gleamed, partially burnt into the scaled skin. then, like a seed germinating, its side bulged out and folded back like a giant eyelid, and from there extruded a massive pseudopod tree. the damaged sphere’s effort was small by comparison, but they joined again, a thousand blue lights winking out. the two drew together, spinning slowly at first then faster the closer together they came. next they were one, spinning hard and melding into one titanic sphere.

the spin of this one sphere slowed over several hours. Mika fed herself meanwhile from her supplies, drank thirstily and dozed with her head against a pane that felt warm despite vacuum being less than an inch away. at last she felt some of the mugginess clearing from her head and found the inclination to anger. Jerusalem must have been aware of the first sphere’s intention, had perhaps instructed it to find its fellow. the AI must also have realized what a perfect piece of confirmatory evidence the contents of her skull would make. doubtless, much that had happened here had been planned. however, she had been in huge danger  --  probably still was.

when the spin finally ceased the large sphere slowly began to acquire a waist, which grew narrower and narrower until an hourglass Dragon hung in void before her. finally the two halves separated, and two unmarred Dragon spheres resulted. Mika found she could not maintain her anger, knowing she would be more angry to have missed this. as the glare of fusion flames caught her eye, and she turned to observe the approach of the <e>Jerusalem</e> , she smiled to herself.

those on the rock face above were the same mix of biomechanisms Cormac fought earlier in the jungle. below swarmed a multitude of the salamander creatures  --  all six limbs angled to grip stone as they squirmed their way up. but the rod-ships would come first, from above.

One of them dropped down directly opposite the ledge and slowly drew in. knowing he could detonate the CTD with just a thought, Cormac decided he would wait until it extruded one of those tentacular growths, then he would turn this place into an inferno. however, the ship halted some yards out, and its side unzipped and peeled back, revealing a figure clamped in the fleshy interior. in the moment it took him to flick Shuriken out ahead of him, Cormac expected to see a hostage. but this was no hostage.

Cormac stabbed a thumb over his shoulder. [h|Arach already killed someone who looked just like you. I guess now it’s my turn to do the same].

[h|just as humans can be recorded, so can I], replied the Legate.

[h|that’s nice]. Cormac peered down at the CTD, wondering why he even bothered with this conversation.

[h|why?]. asked the Legate. [h|why resist like this and finally throw away your lives?].

looking up, Cormac replied, [h|because you will take our minds apart to find information useful to you, and discard the rest. you’ll either kill us in the process but, worse than that, you might decide to use us like automatons. you are Jain-based and that seems the way such technology operates].

[h|we would not utilize anything so ineffective].

[h|death, then. I take it this <a>we</a> refers to yourself and some controlling intelligence].

[h|I am one with Erebus].

[h|him being?].

[h|the one who melds us all].

<e>enough</e>.

Cormac sent a command to Shuriken and the throwing star accelerated towards the Legate. simultaneously, a gap appeared in the craft’s exterior beside the Legate, and something shot out towards Cormac. One of those octopoids he saw earlier. Shuriken veered and sliced through this object.

<e>time</e> ….

the blast lifted him from his feet and hurled him backwards. he glimpsed burning flesh fountaining from the top of the rod-ship, around the turquoise pillar of a particle beam. the ship seemed to deflate as it dropped from sight, flames bursting around the now flopping figure of the Legate. as he ducked for cover with the others, towards the back of the ledge, Cormac observed the CTD roll away and fall from sight. burning biomechanisms rained down, piling on the ledge itself then falling further in smouldering masses. acrid smoke filled the air. somewhere a boom, and fragments vaguely identifiable as bits of other rod-ships rained down through the volcanic chimney.

[h|what the fuck?]. said someone, inevitably.

<e>Polity?</e>.

as Shuriken snicked back into his wrist holster, Cormac dared to hope. he peered up through hellish fire but saw only the spiral ship still hovering above. next, from below, objects streaked upwards  --  he had been looking in the wrong direction. the missiles slammed into the underside of the spiral ship, and the series of ensuing flashes darkened Cormac’s visor. when it cleared he saw one half of the great ship falling aside, trailing fire, exposed girders like bones glowing white hot. it crashed just out of sight, shuddering the stone beneath Cormac, and a wave of burning jungle spilled over the lip above. the remaining half of it seemed to be managing to draw away, but then another missile impacted. incandescent fire burned out from its insides, exploding in jets from the surviving hull, and that half too fell from sight. the survivors crouched instinctively as further detonations shook the stone all around them. then, up beside them rose a Polity attack ship of the same style as the <e>Jack Ketch</e> . its original hull, where still visible between numerous repairs, glittered metallic blue. A bay door irised open in its side and a ramp extruded.

from inside issued a voice. [h|the USER is down, so I think it time to leave, don’t you?].

Cormac recognized that voice because he distinctly remembered his last exchange with it:

[h|<e>you saw that I did not gain access to Skellor  --  or to Jain technology?</e>].

[h|<e>so</e> ], <e>Cormac managed</e>.

[h|<e>tell Jerusalem that</e> ].

they ran for the ramp, their choices being limited, though Cormac wondered how much better they might now fare aboard the <e>King of Hearts</e> . the rogue AI controlling this ship did not tend to show much regard for anyone standing between it and its objectives.

once they were inside the ramp swiftly withdrew. the bay door slammed shut, then abrupt acceleration threw them to the deck. Cormac could not breathe, and noticed the acceleration even kept Arach, the dracomen and the remaining Golem pinned immobile. A telefactor rolled out on treads and began by relieving Cormac of Shuriken, then went on to collect up the rest of their weapons. he could still feel his gridlink connection to the bomb down below, and sent the signal to detonate it  --  perhaps futile, but it gave him some satisfaction to know that any of those biomechs remaining in the volcanic chimney would now be turned to ash. minutes later, the telefactor withdrew, but acceleration still held them pinned to the floor.

they were helpless, but at least alive.

as he hurtled up through atmosphere, King pondered his reasons for rescuing these Polity personnel and understood that in truth he found more in common with them than with the multipart entity spread through space above. he wanted back into the Polity. he longed for forgiveness. but, with cold and exacting logic, knew it would not be forthcoming. his complicity in the deaths of so many humans on the world Cull would be enough for a sentence of erasure to be proposed, though the outcome there was not certain since he did not actually take a direct part in any killing. however, his destruction of the <e>Jack Ketch</e> , and the AI it contained, made erasure a certainty, should he be captured.

breaching from atmosphere, King immediately noted that there were not so many of Erebus’s minions as he supposed, and a lot of debris. he registered numerous signatures of ships dropping into U-space, and realized that, with the USER now down, they were fleeing. however, many weapons targeted the <e>King of Hearts</e> and in reply he began emptying the stash he had manufactured while hiding in that volcanic chimney.

the chimney was a fortuitous find, since his first plan had involved slamming himself into radioactive earth for concealment. he detected it only microseconds before the multiple blast from the missiles sent to destroy him threw up from the mountains material that could be mistakenly identified as parts of himself. decelerating hard, he smashed in through the rocky mouth of the chimney and crashed down inside. when he hit the bottom, tons of stone and dust rained on top of him. he powered down all systems, excepting chameleonware nowhere near as effective as possessed by the new Polity ships nearby. but it was enough, for none of Erebus’s minions detected him.

over the ensuing months King made his repairs: sending out telefactors to collect refinable ores from the surrounding cave systems, sucking up briny water from below and separating from it both deuterium and pure water to fuel his fusion reactor and engines. when the USER that had trapped him first went offline, he was in no condition to go anywhere. as a precaution, over ensuing months, he manufactured drones no larger than a human head, from non-metallic materials, and launched them  --  some to take position on the surface of the planet, some out in space, and all using passive scanning. when the USER came back on again, he lay in a perfect position to observe what ensued  --  the battle fought by those new Polity Centurion-class attack ships. the second time the USER went offline  --  this time it quite evidently had not been powered down but destroyed  --  he readied himself to run, Erebus being otherwise occupied. he waited for the moment the biomechs finished off those Polity personnel who had landed here, and themselves left. but next, all hell broke loose right on top of him.

<e>bastard, that</e>.

but why did he act when he did?. the chances of him being discovered had grown exponentially as Erebus dickered about above him in the volcanic chimney. A quick strike and then an even quicker escape were what was required. so why had he stopped to take on these passengers on the way up?. there seemed no easy answer to that.

gaps everywhere. though swarming in their hundreds even now, Erebus’s forces had still taken a severe pasting from those Centurions, and seemed somewhat in disarray. King felt a strange sort of pride in that.

<e>my sort</e>.

he dropped into U-space just as his weapons carousel clicked on empty.

the <e>Battle Wagon</e> went first, then in waves the other ships followed, winking from black existence. Azroc watched armoured shutters draw across the chainglass screen, as they would be drawn across many other screens throughout the <e>Brutal Blade</e> . next the ship’s U-space engines came online with a grumble that reverberated through its massive hull, and warning lights came on inside to indicate that it had entered that continuum. knowing ten hours of journey time would now ensue, unless the USER came back on, Azroc stepped back from the screen and, making an internal adjustment, shut himself down. as he descended into the Golem equivalent of unconsciousness, he understood that many of the humans aboard would not find it so easy to disconnect themselves from the world.

later, Azroc roused, immediately conscious and thoroughly aware of his surroundings. A brief contact with the ship’s AI, Brutus, confirmed the passing of nine hours.

[h|we are one hour from surfacing into realspace], the AI informed him.

[h|reconaissance first?].

[h|we have sent four scout ships, though I suspect any trap will not be visible to them].

Azroc turned away and headed over to where Karischev and his men were ensconced.

the Sparkind units occupied cylindrical dormitories overlooking bays for landing craft. the humans and Golem mostly lay on their bunks, though the Golem needed no rest and such activities were engendered by their emulation programs. only a few still checked over their equipment, since most checks had been carried out ad nauseam before now. many gathered around screens and tactical displays positioned at either end of the dormitories. Azroc found Karischev standing before one of these.

[h|A quick scan of the system first], declared the man, [h|then we go through].

[h|Four scout ships, apparently], Azroc agreed.

[h|of course we’ll probably be sitting on our butts during any ship-to-ship battle. but I’m told there are two living planets here the AIs don’t want to burn, so we’ll probably be sent to them to clear up anything the big guns can’t hit without destroying ecologies].

[h|and to find those personnel who were set down on one of those planets].

[h|yeah  --  if there’s anything left of them to be found. the information we received makes that look increasingly unlikely]  --  Karischev paused  --  [h|though, admittedly, dracomen and Sparkind, along with Horace Blegg and Ian Cormac, are more likely to survive the shitstorm there than most].

[h|admittedly], Azroc conceded.

[h|y’know], Karischev added, [h|I never used to believe those two characters existed. I thought they were fictional, like King Arthur or Rasputin].

Azroc considered the irony of this statement before replying, [h|well, apparently they are real].

the ensuing half-hour dragged past slowly, then one of the tactical displays changed to show the situation within the system they intended to enter. hundreds of enemy ships were revealed scattered across vacuum, but many less now than shown previously.

[h|data from the scouts], Azroc commented, while they watched some of the alien ships blink out of existence. [h|the enemy are fleeing].

[h|sensible of them], Karischev replied.

precisely on time, the entire fleet surfaced from U-space and began to deploy. immediately the main displays changed to reveal a contracted view of the planetary system, with all its worlds gathered much closer than would be possible in reality, the various ships swarming about them like fish around reefs. all the fleet ships were represented by blue dots, and the enemy ships indicated in red. Azroc identified the <e>Battle Wagon</e>  --  close by in interplanetary terms  --  its cylindrical shape still discernible. while they watched, a viewing square picked out a group of enemy ships with fleet ships closing in on them and expanded the view. then another square picked out one of the main enemy ships and displayed it on a side-screen. the large ammonite spiral spun, darkly iridescent, light flashing from the junctures between its segments and from the inner loops of its spirals. he only glimpsed the occasional object speeding away from it, but a glance at one of the tactical displays revealed the same ship launching a barrage at approaching Polity ships. then it bucked as if slapped on the edge by a giant’s hand. the screen blanked for a second, then the vessel flew apart: lengths of spiral and separate segments hurtling away.

[h|modular construction], he commented.

[h|get this], said Karischev, pointing at something new displayed on another screen.

now they watched as the <e>Battle Wagon</e> headed into a conglomeration of enemy ships, its weapons firing and wreaking havoc all around. spiral ships burned internally and spun apart, rod-ships detonated like linked firecrackers.

[h|this is not going to last very long], said Azroc.

[h|yeah, maybe], said Karischev.

Azroc was about to comment further when he picked up something over general tac-com channels, and then saw the same information flashed up on the displays before them. another larger and more powerful USER had just been deployed within the system.

[h|oh fuck], said Karischev.

from behind the ringed ice giant rose into view that other strange metallic planetoid  --  its presence briefly acknowledged in initial reports from the <e>NEJ</e> . it was no longer so smooth and clearly defined, for massive outflows broke from its surface like cold solar flares. A frame selected this object, and focused in on the surface movement. Azroc now saw the planetoid unravelling, returning to its component parts  --  which were thousands of enemy ships.

[h|you might be right], said Karischev.

[h|pardon?].

[h|this might not last long at all].

the initial part of her report Mika delivered with much reference to her notescreen but, of course, in the latter stages of events she had been unable to make any notes at all. she spoke slowly and carefully, visualizing events in her mind as she described them. D’nissan, Prator Colver and Susan James  --  the last recently returned from her enforced and medicated rest  --  all now wore the top level of augs and showed impatience with that sluggish transference of information called speech. when she finished, they thanked her and, with no social niceties, quickly departed.

[h|was that entirely necessary?]. Mika asked, as she began stripping off her Dragon-repaired clothing while heading for the shower.

[h|your clothing], instructed Jerusalem, [h|place it in secure sampling cylinders and send it to D’nissan’s laboratory].

Mika grimaced. she should have thought of that already, but excused herself because she had, after all, been through a lot. naked, she picked up her strewn clothing and carried it through to her own laboratory, stuffed it into two sampling cylinders, sealed them, then placed them in the wall hatch, whence they sped away. the system was similar to that one used to send cash cylinders by compressed air through pipework leading down into the vault of an ancient casino, though of course much more sophisticated.

[h|how often do I do the unnecessary?]. Jerusalem enquired as she finally stepped into her shower.

[h|that is something on which I can only speculate].

though already thoroughly scanned, she somehow felt Jerusalem, speaking to her here and now, to be intrusive. absurd, really. AIs constantly monitored their charges, and she had been thus monitored for many years. why did it bother her now?. she supposed that might be because of her recent intimacy with Dragon, and tried to ignore the feeling.

[h|your three fellow researchers, like many others aboard this vessel, require constant grounding in the real world. I give them this whenever the opportunity presents].

Mika ignored the air-blast dryer  --  she did not have the patience for it  --  and stepped out of the shower to grab up a rough towel from the dispenser. as she dried herself a sudden panic surged in her throat, as she glimpsed into the immediate future. she would dress, eat and drink, but she did not feel like sleeping. so what then?. she could not rejoin the other three in their research of things Jain unless she too upgraded herself, either with a gridlink or with one of those augs. the two Dragon spheres, now orbiting the <e>Jerusalem</e> , lay out of her reach  --  any data that could be obtained from them at a distance was already collected.

<e>what do I do now?</e>.

she decided to attack. [h|you used me as confirmation of events  --  extra evidence to persuade the other Dragon sphere to our side].

[h|yes, I did].

[h|no denials, then. just that: <e>you did</e> . you played me like a pawn in your game. I could have died].

[h|obviously there were risks, but the possible gains outweighed them].

Mika considered that, and also considered the utter pointlessness of protesting. AIs, so they would have humanity believe, calculated their actions on the basis of the greater good for all. she just sometimes wondered what their conception of the [h|greater good] might be.

she tied a loose robe about herself and slumped on her sofa. during her interview with the other three she had felt the <e>Jerusalem</e> enter underspace.

[h|where are we going now?].

[h|To the edge of a scene of conflict, though a USER prevents us from entering].

[h|could you elaborate on that?].

[h|you have not been keeping up-to-date. let me begin by telling you about a being called the Legate …].

as Jerusalem explained the situation, Mika began to feel ashamed. she realized that while she occupied herself with such petty concerns, Cormac might be dying, or already dead.

it would have been foolish to try flying through the approaching Polity fleet, even in U-space, so Orlandine necessarily waited until it entered the inner system.

<e>too long</e>.

with delight Orlandine had manoeuvred the <e>Heliotrope</e> out of the comet and back into space, but that delight only lasted a few minutes  --  until the second USER came online. A trap for someone else, obviously, but one that snared her as well.

<e>again</e>.

but now what?. should she return to her hideaway inside the comet and wait until this ended?. checking U-space interference, she first realized this USER field extended for much further than a mere light year …. then that it was strongest in her present location, which seemed to indicate the device generating it must be nearby. its activation had been perfectly timed so as to drop the Polity fleet ships into a trap in the inner system. scanning her immediate vicinity revealed the usual quantity of cold lumps of rock, but the candidate she eventually plumped for was a planetoid half the size of Earth’s moon, and only 100,000 miles away from her. passive scanning revealed it to be much warmer than it should be, at this distance from the sun, and that it contained an ocean of liquid methane inside a crust of rock and water-ice as hard as iron.

rather than immediately send <e>Heliotrope</e> in that direction, Orlandine waited and began to take measurements. within a few hours she ascertained that the shift of USER-field strength exactly matched the planetoid’s orbital path. confirmation, then. now she needed to figure out how to get herself over there without being detected. the <e>Heliotrope</e> ’s drifting path diverged from that of the planetoid, and firing up her engines out here would be like igniting a flare in the darkness, so any detectors would pick her up instantly. it took her only seconds to work out the solution to this dilemma. using air jets, she could manoeuvre into a position which, in twenty-three minutes, would bring her into collision with one of the asteroidal masses. prior to that collision she could fire her fusion engines undetected for 0.6 of a second into the asteroid’s surface. this was predicated on any detectors being sited only on the planetoid, which was a risk she would have to take. this move would take her on to the next asteroid. three similar trajectory changes in all would result in <e>Heliotrope</e> being set on a course to intercept the planetoid’s orbit. landing there without using the engines would be well within ship’s specs, and <e>Heliotrope</e> possessed mooring harpoons that could prevent it bouncing away in the low gravity. after that things would become rather more complicated, for Orlandine must somehow figure out how to destroy a USER, which she rather suspected lay in the methane sea, a thousand miles below the surface.

as, some hours later, she finally approached the planetoid, Orlandine noted signs of occupation. large areas had been ground flat in a landscape of contorted ice seemingly formed by the water freezing while large bubbles had spread through it, and subsequently subliming away so that only curves and sharp edges remained. A few blasts from the air jets brought her ship down in one of the clear zones, and she wondered if the craft would have survived a landing in one of those other unlevelled areas. at this temperature water-ice could possess the consistency of steel and much of that contorted ice looked dangerously sharp. <e>Heliotrope</e> ’s hull might be constructed of layered composite with an outer skin of ceramal, but it still could be damaged.

as the ship skidded on a gritty layer of flattened ice, blowing up an iridescent cloud, she fired the mooring harpoons and observed their explosive heads drive home. possibly there were seismic detectors on this planetoid, but hopefully what they detected would be dismissed as just natural settling of the crust.

<e>now the difficult part</e> ….

controlling <e>Heliotrope</e> ’s external hardware directly, the ship being designed as a working vessel rather than simply for transport, Orlandine extruded a drill from its belly and immediately started boring down through ice and rock. while this was in process, she assessed her various supplies and considered her options. <e>Heliotrope</e> contained only five slow-burn CTDs, of the kind used at the Cassius project for melting and causing ice build-ups on large structures to sublime. these might melt a hole through the planetoid’s outer crust, but would have little effect on the USER unless she could position them right next to it, which seemed highly unlikely. however, carefully studying the sensor returns from the drill head, she began to see …. possibilities.

Orlandine found the crust of this planetoid rather interesting, and wondered what spectacular events had resulted in such a high concentration of sodium chloride  --  in the form of frozen brine  --  and the abundance of other chlorine compounds. perhaps the planetoid had formed from the debris of a gas giant, for similar concentrations also could be found at the Cassius project. the presence of these chemicals indicated the possible presence of something else here, and eighty yards down she found it: a layer of pure chlorine frozen solid at these temperatures. whatever process had formed this planetoid must have involved extremely rapid freezing for so reactive a compound not to combine with others. perfect.

the drill bit finally broke through a hundred yards down and, until Orlandine injected sealant around the shaft, the <e>Heliotrope</e> sat momentarily on a geyser of methane turning partially to snow, but quickly subliming in near vacuum. withdrawing the drill shaft’s central core, she then pushed a probe down into the methane sea and, using a passive seismic detector, scanned the planetoid’s interior. very soon she built a virtual image in her mind.

the USER device lay at the sea’s precise centre, the massive singularity it contained holding it in place. from this spherical core protruded numerous structures like aerial-clad city blocks. just under the planetoid’s crust she detected other devices, perhaps sensors or weapons. One of these lay only half a mile away from her, so instantly she trained <e>Heliotrope</e> ’s sensors in its direction on the surface, and discerned how the exterior of this device resembled a cylindrical bunker sheathed in ice. but there seemed no activity from there as yet.

now maintaining close contact with the ship and all its sensors, ready to launch at a moment’s notice, she eased herself from her seat and moved back into the ship’s hold. Jain technology, inevitably, held the solution. linking to her nanoassembler, she input the parameters for the nanomachines she required. it soon became apparent that nanomachines would not work in such low temperatures, so a mycelium would be required: one that would spread around the interior of the planetoid’s crust below her, one that could inject itself through ice and rock to seek out the deposits of pure chlorine. unfortunately she needed to remain here while the mycelium performed its task, because it would need to be powered by the ship’s fusion reactor.

the basic structure would be a skein of nanotubes created by microscopic factories catalysing carbon from the methane. those same nanotubes, at this temperature, would also be superconductive so there would be no problem supplying power. sensors would keep the main spread of the mycelial threads on the undersurface of the crust; micromotors would be laid every few tenths of an inch to stretch or slacken nanotubes and so guide growth; quantum processors, manufactured from the same carbon as the nanotubes, would control the whole process. however, at frequent intervals, the growing mycelium would inject nanotubes into the rock and ice above to seek out chlorine deposits. these would require nanoscopic drilling heads and peristaltic inner layers to transport chlorine molecules back down to the main mycelium and into the methane sea. methodically, and brilliantly, Orlandine began constructing her nanomycelium. after an hour or so, she paused, remembering something else that would be required: a bright blue light to shine on the subject.

she smiled nastily to herself.
