<e>thin-gun: there is still much debate about whether this weapon, much loved by holofiction producers, was first introduced fictionally or actually. I’ll get back to that shortly, but first let me describe this weapon: well, for a start, it’s thin. ECS took the components of a typical gas-system or aludust pulse-gun, reduced them to their smallest size, and flattened them. the basic ethos behind this weapon is that it is easily concealed  --  being flat, it does not bulk in clothing. as such it is the main choice for those regularly working undercover, be they Polity agents or criminals. further developments by ECS resulted in microtok-charged energy canisters  --  combined with either a gas or powdered aluminium load  --  being constructed small enough to insert into the handle of this weapon in the form of a clip. some thin-guns contain a sub-AI micromind that can prevent the gun being fired by anyone other than its rightful owner, or can cause it to detonate its own power supply if pointed at its owner, and can even make a moral decision about whether or not it wants to fire at all. but, returning to the fiction/fact debate concerning these weapons, the first fictional thin-gun appeared in a VR interactive game, before the Polity became a distinct entity and before the runcible-based expansion. despite the rather savage methods the authorities employed at that time, corporate police</e> <e>were never able to trace its producer. the interactive, though withdrawn from sale through licensed outlets because of its seditious content, sold very well on the black market and rose to attain cult status. subsequent investigations revealed its producer to be very probably one of the rogue AIs involved in the Quiet War. the same AI may well be still extant  --  though it’s not telling</e>.

 --  from [h|how it is] by Gordon

the solar system, still in the process of forming out of an accretion disc, contained thirty-two planetary masses, eight about the same size as Neptune or Uranus, and two further Jovian masses, the rest falling into the size range between Neptune and Earth. other masses  --  asteroids, moons, comets  --  numbered in trillions. gas and dust shrouded all, meteor strikes and massive storms lit the interior intermittently, as did the slowly growing sporadic luminosity of the nascent sun, as fusion fires fought with black spots for dominance of the solar sphere.

the Legate’s vessel surfaced half an AU out and proceeded inwards on fusion drive. the moment the four Centurions surfaced, a U-space signature immediately blossomed beside them, and something big dropped into being. they came under immediate and intense scanning from this hugely dense object  --  a two-mile-wide ribbed ammonite spiral glinting metallic green. the shape seemed to imply something grown rather than manufactured, one that could keep on growing. organic technology. it launched a cloud of projectiles that Jack recognized as the same type launched earlier from the subsumed <e>Calydonian</e> Boar. these now swarmed towards the four Polity Centurions like twilight mosquitoes anxious to feast. confident the other ships would be doing the same, Jack engaged his chameleonware and immediately changed course.

more U-space signatures now, on the edge of the accretion disc, then close by. bacilliform ships began appearing, more spiral forms, lens shapes, indistinct wormish conglomerations breaking and reforming, and sheetlike masses that only closer scan revealed to be constructed of conjoined bacilliforms. some of these objects were no larger than a human fist, others extended miles across.

[h|doesn’t seem too healthy around here], Jack commented. it took him just a microsecond to transmit that message, and he did not see precisely what happened next. the <e>Belisarius</e> must have been struck by some of those seed objects  --  enough at least to disrupt its chameleonware. whereupon that Centurion ship fled  --  masers refracting around its hull, then beginning to impinge  --  leaving an orange trail of metal vapour through space. A wall of bacilliforms, a thousand miles tall, U-jumped directly ahead of the fleeing ship. Jack shut down his ’ware, bringing all his weapons online. he saw the <e>Haruspex</e> and <e>Coriolanus</e> do the same. the big spiral ship bore down on the <e>Belisarius</e> , while the wall of rodlike ships folded in around it like some huge tissue employed for catching a wasp. blights of missiles rained down on all sides. Jack’s CTD imploder hit the big spiral ship first, collapsing its middle section and momentarily leaving a glowing doughnut of matter, before the subsequent explosion obliterated the rest. anti-munitions scattered illusions around the <e>Belisarius</e> , but not enough. missile after missile impacted on it, cutting away a nacelle, distorting its shape and peeling away a trail of its armour. it tried to U-jump, but its engine was damaged or some other weapon hit it. it shimmered, everted like a snake skin, disappeared in white fire.

Jack’s own anti-munitions created an image of the <e>NEJ</e> beside him as he re-engaged chameleonware. but that was no distraction for the cloud of rail-gun projectiles hammering up at the ship from underneath. his carousels whirling at blinding speed, he fired a large-yield imploder down towards that cloud, hoping to hoover up most of them, then aimed lower-yield straight CTDs towards a wall of bacilliform ships massing ahead and threw himself into a 100 gravity turn. that was the limit, since the internal gravplates would not compensate for a harder turn, and though the dracomen might survive it, Cormac would not. Blegg, of course, was another matter entirely ….

the physical attack was not all of it. A constant bombardment of informational attack kept trying to breach their coms systems. Jack allowed some of this through, routing it into secure storage. A message constantly repeated: <e>I am Erebus, merge with me, be one</e> .

<e>ah, so that’s what it’s all about</e> , Jack thought. [h|out of here], he sent.

the three remaining ships dropped into U-space and jumped back along their inward course. many of the alien ships followed. breathing space, at least. having located the enemy, the time had now come to call in the big guns. Jack sent a U-space package to the fleet of Polity dreadnoughts, informing them they should come and play. in a matter of days the Centurions would reach them then the pursuing ships would be in serious -- 

suddenly, a solid wall of U-space interference expanded in their course, taking that option away as it slapped them out into realspace. Jack located himself, finding they now lay within the planetary system they had traversed earlier. fusion drives igniting, they ran for cover as their pursuers began to materialize. A wall of those bacilliform ships began to form ahead of them, while masers, lasers and missiles probed space in search of the remaining three chameleonware-concealed Centurions.

[h|well, we strolled straight into that one], observed the Centurion’s AI.

[h|what the hell was that, Jack?]. Cormac asked, also frantically applying at other levels for information.

[h|we assumed we would be able to run], Jack replied. [h|we assumed wrong because the bad guys here possess USERs].

[h|oh shit].

viewing internally, Jack noted Cormac heading for the bridge. he looked rather sick.

[h|Group together], Jack sent. [h|we cut a hole through it at five hundred miles].

all three ships concentrated maser fire on targets directly ahead. no point using missiles in this situation as they would be travelling as fast as any munitions they fired. the planetary system would make a perfect killing field for the three ’ware concealed ships. they would be able to use guerrilla tactics  --  hitting and hiding  --  for some time. but the living crews aboard the three ships were a problem. by the sheer violence of their manoeuvring the aggressors demonstrated that they did not have the same liability aboard them. Jack noticed that some of the pursuers were also apparently fading out of existence, which meant the Centurions had no advantage in possessing chameleonware.

[h|Jack, your hands need to be untied], said Cormac from the acceleration chair in which he had strapped himself. [h|<e>Coriolanus</e> has eight Sparkind aboard, and <e>Haruspex</e> has sixteen plus Thorn. here we have myself and Blegg and nearly a hundred dracomen. I suggest a fast shuttle drop over one of the inhabited worlds, then you can manoeuvre properly].

it seemed the only sensible move. their living occupants at least stood a better chance down on the surface of a planet than aboard Centurions that could not manoeuvre properly or aboard smaller vessels dropped in vacuum.

Cormac continued, [h|I’ve already transmitted orders to the others to load up with weapons and supplies …. I’m presuming reinforcements will be on the way?].

[h|they should be].

[h|how long?].

[h|days only, supposing the USER is shut down. we are presently trying to locate it. its range is not large  --  about a light-year radius]. he did not add that should the USER not be shut down, the dreadnoughts would take more than a year to arrive, for Cormac knew that.

[h|and your chances of shutting it down?].

[h|good, against the present forces, but we have yet to locate it].

[h|then you drop us. run for the nearest of those living planets. which one is it?].

[h|the hot one].

[h|within range of the standard envirosuit?].

[h|yes].

[h|transmit everything you have on that world to my gridlink]. Cormac began unstrapping himself. [h|time to get ready].

Jack could not help but notice the tired fatalism in Cormac’s voice. the AI pondered the situation for a microsecond, then opened a secure com channel.

[h|you don’t need to leave], he said to the recipient.

[h|but nevertheless I shall].

[h|the issue is not just one of danger to your physical body  --  captured, you would be a very useful source of information to any enemy].

[h|I outrank you], Blegg replied, [h|and I’m bloody well going]. he cut the channel.

as an afterthought, Jack sent another internal message: [h|Arach, I think you just found what you were hoping for].

Blegg’s ship dropped from the <e>NEJ</e> and accelerated away under high G, following the two shuttles containing most of the dracomen, which had departed a few minutes earlier. Cormac glanced back at the spider-drone squatting directly behind him, then at the thirty dracomen packed beyond it, then returned his attention to the screen. further ahead, the two other shuttles that had departed even earlier, containing Thorn and the Sparkind, were entering atmosphere, their nose cones now cupped in orange brilliance.

[h|proceed directly to the coordinates], he instructed Thorn over com. [h|grab your stuff and get out fast once you arrive there. the shuttles may well be targeted].

while receiving information direct to his gridlink, and modelling the positions of the three Polity ships and the enemy vessels, Cormac directed his attention specifically to the lower row of subscreens, to ascertain the order of events in their vicinity. he watched as one of the spiral ships unravelled under concentrated fire from both the <e>Coriolanus</e> and the <e>Haruspex</e> . an exterior flash momentarily blanked all subscreens and caused the main cockpit screen to darken. the spiral ammonite ship became a spreading cloud of burning fragments. their own vessel lurched to one side as something speared past it and down towards the leading shuttles. A vapour trail suddenly knifed out from this projectile and it detonated.

[h|maser], commented Blegg. it seemed that the Centurions above were still covering them.

their ship hit atmosphere, an orange glow around the cockpit screen and sparks flicking up past from the rapidly heating nose cone. this would be no gentle AG descent  --  they could not afford the time for that. the craft began to shudder.

the <e>NEJ</e> became invisible, then it reappeared, 1,000 miles to one side, to strafe some ball of wormish objects squirming through vacuum. it came out of that attack in a high-G turn that would, despite the internal gravplates, have converted any human aboard into bone fragments and bloody sludge. A CTD blew behind it, completely deleting from existence the object of its assault. <e>NEJ</e> now rejoined the other ships, which put themselves between the attackers and the planet. it seemed like three matadors facing a stampede of bulls.

now deeper in atmosphere, the roar of their descent impinged. far to their left a cross-hatching of red lines cut the horizon. below these, bright fires ignited, then a disc of cloud spread directly above.

<e>rail-gun missiles</e>.

if that fusillade had come down directly on them they would be dead by now.

[h|they are not concentrating on us], said Blegg.

[h|I realize that], Cormac agreed.

Blegg relentlessly added, [h|with that kind of firepower, they won’t need to hunt us down  --  they could just take out this entire planet].

[h|you’re such a bundle of joy], Cormac observed.

the curve of the horizon now rose high in the screen. the two dracomen shuttles from <e>NEJ</e> now sat low and to their right, and the two leading Sparkind shuttles were far ahead, just seen as black dots containing the white stars of fusion drives. the sky above them lightened to a pale green, then suddenly a sun-bright explosion ignited within it. Cormac lost com through his gridlink, and could no longer view in his mind the battle above.

[h|Jack?].

nothing in response  --  it could mean that the <e>NEJ</e> had been destroyed, but he could not know right then, might never know. A few minutes later Blegg’s vessel lurched as the shockwave impacted. Cormac was about to make some comment on this when Blegg jerked the joystick violently to one side. rail-gun missiles knifed down at forty-five degrees from behind. One missile found a target and Cormac saw one of the dracomen shuttles cartwheeling through the air, its rear end sheared off, humanoid figures tumbling out. the pilot obviously engaged its gravmotors, trying to stabilize it, and he seemed to be succeeding, then something blew in the shuttle’s side and it dropped like a brick.

[h|fuck], said Cormac. he glanced back at the team of dracomen aboard, who had just lost thirty or so of their comrades. they knew this loss, for it was his understanding that they kept constant mental contact with each other. yet they showed no particular agitation, merely seemed to focus more intently on checking over their weaponry.

To the shuttles escaping ahead he said, [h|if you’ve got gravharnesses aboard, put them on now]. by the silence that met this instruction he supposed Thorn and Bhutan could think of no sufficiently polite reply.

A mountain range reared over the horizon, like rotten teeth in a lower jaw, while a ceiling of grey cloud slid overhead. the leading shuttles penetrated a cloud wall and winked out. as soon as Blegg’s vessel followed them in, he touched some control and the cloud wall seemed to simply disappear. this ship’s scanning gear formed the view from emitted radiation that could penetrate the murk, and showed a terrain of steep valleys quickly filled with steaming red growth. lower now, the sound within the shuttle turning to a dull roar; a subscreen revealing that they now flew through heavy, dirty-looking rain. the jungle melded together until it covered the ground right to the horizon. the leading Sparkind shuttles turned as did the remaining dracoman shuttle. Blegg checked coordinates and adjusted his ship’s course.

[h|what’s that?]. Cormac asked, seeing some object dropping in behind the leading shuttles.

Blegg accelerated the vessel. normally used only for the orbital insertion of troops, and supposedly covered by their mother ships, the shuttles were armed only with lasers. but right now those mother ships were rather busy. Blegg’s vessel, however, carried rail-gun missile launchers and pulse-cannons in its forward nacelles. he brought weapons systems online. laser flashes now became visible between the leading shuttles and the object approaching them. Blegg glanced at Cormac. [h|take control of the weapons].

through his gridlink, Cormac applied to the onboard computer, which instantly routed him to weapons control. once again his sensory field expanded as data from the ship’s sensors came through to him. sitting in the copilot’s seat, his view now included more than just the screens: it encompassed a wider visual area plus radar returns, and microwave and gravity maps of a huge volume surrounding the ship. he now also controlled targeting frames, and his virtual fingers wrapped around virtual triggers.

Thorn’s voice came over com, [h|message to self: boredom is good!].

[h|we’ll be with you in thirty seconds], Cormac replied as he laid a frame over the object pursuing the shuttles, obtained full acquisition of it, and fired. the ship bucked and white streaks cut the air on either side of it. [h|but the missiles will be with you earlier], he added.

now Cormac focused the ship’s sensors and enlarged an image  --  transferring it to a subscreen for Blegg also to see. this revealed one of the bacilliform ships, precisely the rod-like shape of a bacterium but about twenty yards long, with its exterior a completely featureless blue-grey except where the lasers struck it, leaving livid burns like bruises. whatever propulsion system it used showed no visual evidence, so Cormac assumed it must be somehow utilizing antigravity. while they watched, multiple laser strikes converged on its nose, and it shuddered and slowed like an aggressive dog receiving a reprimanding smack. then it accelerated again.

[h|it’s not using any weapons], Cormac noted, [h|and it can’t be some kind of bomb. One that large wouldn’t need to get so close to the shuttles].

[h|capture], explained Blegg bluntly. [h|if they really wanted to take us out, we would be dead by now].

the strange vessel drew itself within a hundred yards of the rearmost Sparkind shuttle, then the two missiles finally reached it. One massive blast turned it into a cloud of burning debris. Cormac quickly threw the second missile into a holding pattern. it overflew the explosion, circled round. no need to recall it or make it safe, for now ten more of those rod-ships were approaching. obeying new instructions the missile shot off on an entirely new course. Blegg looked at him questioningly, so Cormac threw a radar display up on a subscreen to show him what was happening. A few seconds later they watched the missile reduce the number of approaching rod-ships to nine. the flash of the explosion lit the cockpit screen, then suddenly the nine ships became visible through it.

[h|how long to the landing area?]. Cormac asked.

[h|five minutes], Blegg replied.

over com Cormac said, [h|I repeat: no delays once you’re down  --  we’ve got incoming].

Thorn replied, [h|yeah, we see them].

three of the rod-ships pursued the two Sparkind shuttles while the other six turned towards Blegg’s ship and the remaining dracoman shuttle. Cormac created then loaded a search-and-destroy program into six missiles, and fired them one after another. that left him with just twelve explosive missiles, the pulse-cannons and a laser. some EMP knocked three of the missiles from the sky, and Cormac tried to re-acquire them as they fell. the three remaining missiles impacted, bursting rod-ships in actinic explosions and scattering their debris across the sky. he managed to stabilize two of the falling missiles a hundred yards from the jungle canopy and brought them back on target. he then considered instructing Blegg to close up on the rod-ship now hurtling towards the dracoman shuttle, but Blegg anticipated him and turned their vessel. Cormac brought the pulse-cannons online, and they roared steadily. the first fusillade blackened the rod-ship with burn holes, but only briefly slowed it. Two more such hits and it began to pour out smoke, then it abruptly dropped from the sky. by then the two returning missiles found their targets. Blegg brought their own vessel up through the smoke and a sleet of debris, like burning skin, and accelerated towards the other three attackers, which now closed rapidly on the two lead shuttles.

Cormac selected and fired another six of the remaining missiles, target acquisition locked, and identification programs running so they would not mistake the escaping shuttles for enemy craft.

[h|can this bucket go any faster?]. he asked.

[h|we’ll overshoot if we do, and lose manoeuvrability].

[h|okay].

the missiles he fired moved ahead of the ship quite slowly. Cormac focused beyond them, pulling up images in his gridlink and on one of the subscreens. One of the rod-ships had drawn very close to the rearmost shuttle  --  less than fifty yards away from it. at present relative speeds, no missile would reach the assailant before it reached its target. perhaps it would be forced to slow, as laser strikes were turning its front end blue-black and it trailed smoke and occasionally belched oily flame from splits in its surface. suddenly, however, the attacking object surged ahead, as if finding some grip on the very air. it thumped down on the shuttle and stuck to it. Cormac instantly cancelled it as a target.

com: [h|shuttle Two, gravharnesses <e>now</e> . get out of there!].

shuttle and rod-ship began to plummet. Cormac tracked them tightly and kept focused in. the rod-ship deflated as it extruded a hundred rootlike growths to wrap around the shuttle.

[h|the lock’s jammed, screens covered], came Bhutan’s reply. [h|will attempt to blow --] just then the beleaguered shuttle’s drive abruptly cut out and, encompassed in a mass of organic growth, it began tumbling through the sky. screams issued over com, and Cormac listened only briefly before he shut down the connecting comlink and instantly sent transmissions to the other shuttles instructing them to accept nothing further on that channel. Sparkind did not scream easily, but Cormac knew just how quickly Jain technology could take control of a human being. then, in the time it took him to blink, the white flash then massive blast of a tactical CTD erased the shuttle. someone aboard had retained enough presence of mind to know they would not be getting out of there alive, and took the enemy with them.

belatedly, two further explosions as a pair of the missiles destroyed the last two attackers.

[h|that could have gone --] Cormac began, but suddenly a shadow drew across the sky, and under it a bright light flared. before the sound of the explosion impinged, horizon and jungle were already whipping past the screen. then came the massive blast and Blegg’s vessel was spinning and falling through burning debris. Cormac considered warning the dracomen to brace themselves for impact, and rejected the idea. it seemed pointless to state the obvious.

the bacilliform ships did not shoot back, though they kicked out a huge amount of EM interference which increased as they conjoined. it seemed they were designed to initially blank out communication, then, if a ship drew close enough to one of those walls they formed, to completely disrupt its systems, including the AI mind inside. Jack suspected they served some other purpose as well, for individually they kept trying to make close contact with the Centurions  --  something none of them had yet managed to do. the lens-shaped ships deployed plenty of weaponry, but in a one-on-one fight were no match for the Centurions and were soon disabled or destroyed. those accretions of hundred-foot-long metal worms, once they untangled, became lethal highly intelligent missiles themselves. but the remaining five big ammonite spiral ships remained the greatest danger, for they carried all the armament of a Polity destroyer  --  the wormish things being one weapon they deployed  --  and all the processing power of a runcible AI, for they quickly found solutions to the Centurions] chameleonware. each new program deployed lasted no more than half an hour  --  no time at all during a space battle.

duelling with hardfields against a mile-wide lens-shaped vessel using telefactored warheads, <e>Haruspex</e> seemed in danger of being swamped by a rapidly forming wall of the bacilliforms. Jack sent a coded transmission to <e>Haruspex</e> then swung round in a sharp 400 gravity turn to put the <e>NEJ</e> behind that threatening wall. he fired a combined CTD and EM warhead at the rod-ships then, after a delay, followed it with a fusillade of near-c rail-gun projectiles. <e>Haruspex</e> immediately dropped out of the fight. the missile detonated amid the rod-ships, cutting a hole in the wall they created. the rail-gun projectiles shot through the hole, following the wave of EM radiation. the big lens’s instruments could detect nothing but the EM, so did not react quickly enough to the following projectiles. A hundred impacts collapsed one side of the lens like a punctured balloon. both the <e>NEJ</e> and the <e>Haruspex</e> then used their chameleonware to cover their run towards the spiral ship pursuing <e>Coriolanus</e> .

[h|I have the USER located], Coriolanus reported and sent coordinates.

Jack scanned and confirmed, and Haruspex agreed. during the recent battle they had managed to take readings of the interference strength of the device. it was located on a small moon orbiting the cold world  --  half the planetary system away from their present position.

[h|we have to make the run], Jack informed the other two ships.

[h|that will mean abandoning those on the planet], Coriolanus informed him.

Jack scanned in that direction and saw some of the enemy ships deployed down inside atmosphere. [h|my assessment of our current situation is that by running from the system on conventional drives we could survive. if we stay to protect Cormac and co, we will eventually be destroyed. the greatest hope for them is if we destroy that USER, then return to fight a delaying action until the dreadnoughts arrive. we can only hope our erstwhile passengers manage to survive on the surface].

after a short pause, the other two ships concurred.

the moment his boots hit the soft ground, Thorn’s envirosuit muttered warnings in his ear and flashed them up on his visor. he turned those persistent warnings off, since he did not need the suit to tell him he occupied a highly radioactive area. the incinerated terrain ahead stretched for five hundred miles along the base of the mountains, and seemed likely to be the result of multiple nuclear explosions. however, in this heavy rain, he could see only a few yards ahead  --  in the planet’s lower gravity the raindrops falling slowly were twice the size of those on Earth, and also were turbid with ash as a consequence of explosions that had occurred here.

[h|out-spectrum vision  --  search], he instructed his suit.

after a moment a transparent band drew across his visor directly before his eyes, and within that band the rain seemed simply to be erased. however, above and below the band he could still see the downpour. though accustomed to using this kind of sensory enhancement, he did not trust it, it being too easy to interfere with  --  already the surrounding radioactivity began to cause flecks across his vision. he now surveyed his surroundings.

the remaining dracoman shuttle from the <e>NEJ</e> was just landing, and the soldiers around him were checking their weaponry and loading up ridiculously large packs, while the four autoguns patrolled around them like hounds anxious for the hunt. no badinage passed between the troops. many of them had known Bhutan and the others aboard the Sparkind shuttle that didn’t make it here.

[h|I take it that’s where we want to go?]. Chalter pointed off to Thorn’s left where the lower mountain slopes were now visible. this area had been Cormac’s own choice for various reasons: it lay at the edge of the incinerated area, so provided the option of using the jungle for cover, and if that vegetation turned out to be occupied by a whole chapter of the flesh-eating monsters society, from here they could also head into the mountains, which were riddled with gullies, cave systems, and a sufficient mixture of hot springs, seams of metal, and radioactives from the recent explosions nearby to make it easier for them to hide from detection equipment.

[h|certainly is], Thorn confirmed.

the <e>NEJ</e> shuttle landed and the dracomen disembarked. Thorn noted that again they wore no protective clothing. though there was sufficient oxygen here, any unequipped human would have drowned in this rain, and despite the downpour the temperature reached nearly 50 Celsius. Thorn hauled up his own pack and shouldered it, then over com issued his instructions.

[h|seal up the shuttles and let’s move out. Sparkind, keep to your units  --  cover for imminent attack. dracomen …]. Thorn considered for a moment how he knew the dracomen could perform. [h|scout ahead and find us cover: defensible positions, good visibility, but nothing to get trapped in. let’s get moving].

the dracomen took off at speed, bounding towards the lower slopes. soon loaded up, the Sparkind units followed them, with the autoguns patrolling out to either side. A series of flashes then lit the sky and Thorn supposed Cormac was now engaging the remaining pursuers. he checked his footing before setting out, noticed red shoots of growth like droplets of blood scattered across the ground. then a shadow began drawing across the sky.

[h|Cormac, status?]. he asked.

[h|not too brilliant], the agent growled in reply.

the ship lay upside-down in dense red jungle. through the screen Cormac could see a path of smashed thick stems and enormous smouldering leaves the ship had left as it plunged in backwards. because he had been in similar situations before, he first instructed his envirosuit to close up completely, for any kind of poisonous air mix might be leaking into the ship. the visor shot up out of the neck ring and engaged with the helmet, which extended itself in segmented sections up around the back of his head, from the rear of the neck ring. he then looked across at Blegg beside him.

Horace Blegg had also closed up his own suit.

[h|interesting landing], said Cormac. [h|what the fuck happened?].

[h|high-intensity laser  --  drilled right through our engine], Blegg replied. [h|did you notice the source?].

in the last moment, just before the explosion wiped out the ship’s exterior sensors, he had seen one of the spiral ships descending on them like an express elevator.

[h|I think we need to get out of here  --  fast]. reaching up he hit his strap release and, spinning himself round as he dropped from his seat, came down feet first on the ceiling. Blegg landed there an instant after him. Scar was waiting to the rear of the cockpit, fangs exposed in what was definitely not a grin. Cormac searched round for Arach, then looked up at what had been the floor, and saw the drone still clinging there. [h|well, what are you waiting for?]. the drone needed no more instruction. without descending, it scuttled to the rear of the lander and dropped out through the airlock the dracomen had just opened.

Cormac followed the departing dracomen, snatching up his own pack of supplies, and his proton carbine on the way. once outside, via his gridlink, he instructed both the inner and outer door of the airlock to close, then began leading the way through the pall of smoke and steam around the overturned vessel.

something globular, the size of a potato sack and the colour of old blood, crouched on three legs on the smouldering ground less than ten yards from the ship. it shivered, emitting a warbling squeal. Scar aimed his carbine at the creature, then swung the weapon away. the dracoman clearly knew the creature to be harmless, though it might attract other more dangerous predators. as the dracomen spread out, Cormac glanced up at Arach, now squatting atop the lander, before peering higher into the occluded sky.

[h|nice of them to give us shelter from the rain], he quipped. they stood in a twilight created by the ammonite spiral filling half the sky above them as it slowly descended. [h|Thorn?]. he queried, receiving nothing but static over com. so as to ascertain their position he ran a program to track Thorn’s last signal to them. [h|we’ll see if we can link up], he said to the others, gesturing over to his right into the thick wall of jungle.

his last words were drowned out in a low roar as one of the rod-ships breasted the plant canopy to his left. the dracomen hit the jungle ahead of Cormac as he himself broke into a run. behind him the weird vessel crashed down on the wrecked Polity ship. sheltering for a moment under a leaf like a duvet filled with blood, he observed the rod-ship extrude its tendrils as if it were intent on throttling some opponent, then he heard the sound of rending metal. To one side he saw Arach bouncing along with his spidery legs folded into a caged ball. rolling to a halt the drone abruptly opened out again. hatches then opened in his rear torso, and unfolded two Gatling design cannons. these whirled into action, and both rod-ship and shuttle disappeared under a storm of explosions.

[h|shit!]. Cormac ducked to avoid flying debris. he then glanced up and saw more objects detach from the spiral ship and begin dropping towards them: more rod-ships, writhing anguine things, and translucent coins in which indistinct shapes shifted. then another shape he recognized: the Legate’s vessel, or something very much like it.

[h|save your ammo, Arach  --  you’re going to need it!].

Arach came dancing after him as Cormac stood initiating Shuriken in its holster, then followed Blegg and the dracomen into deeper jungle shade.

they moved fast as the shadow deepened and extended around them with the descent of the spiral ship. most of the surrounding vegetation sported big leaves raised up, three or four yards, on top of thick fibrous stalks, while in their shade lay little undergrowth to hinder progress. in some areas vines shifted like tangles of somnolent red snakes, but these were easily avoided. the ground itself was a spongy lamination of decaying leaves over-spread with fungi like spills of blue paint. around the bases of the fibrous stems, nodular sprouts fisted from the leaf litter, doubtless awaiting the collapse of leaves above them and the subsequent chance of enlivening sunlight. occasionally they would encounter one of those globular red creatures crouching by one of these stems, a crunching sucking sound issuing from underneath it as it grazed on the sprouts.

within a few minutes they reached softer ground. rain rumbled thunderously on the overhead leaves and rivulets of water slithered like drool down the stems. they were out of the huge ship’s shadow now. from behind them came a low roar and then a blast of wind, lifting leaves to let in the actinic glare of the sun, now penetrating cloud.

[h|it’s down!]. Blegg called.

it would not be the only thing come down, Cormac realized. the leaves lifting had given him a glimpse of those objects he earlier observed descending, now falling into the jungle all around them. then he heard something crashing through the canopy over to his right.

[h|we may soon have company], he broadcast over com.

their first company turned out to be one of those tripedal saurians Jack had warned about and detailed in the download to Cormac’s gridlink. its gait on just three long legs was smooth and fast, but utterly bewildering to witness. A whiplike tail flicked around ceaselessly behind it, while on the end of a thick, hinged neck jutted the head of a three-eyed hippopotamus. it emitted a sawing growl as it dodged one of the dracomen, growled again and skidded to a halt when faced with Blegg and two more dracomen. then it took off again as they moved aside for it. numerous weapons carefully tracked its progress, but none was fired, as it showed no inclination to attack and just kept on going.

[h|something spooked it], Blegg observed.

perfectly on cue that same something came hurtling towards them out of the deeper shade.

it might be some indigene of this strange world, yet instantly reminded Cormac of the creatures Chaline had seen attacking the expedition sent to the Small Magellanic Cloud. its thorax extended fifteen feet long, seemingly camouflage painted in the shades of red of the vegetation surrounding them, and was flanged on either side as if made to glide. its head, an ugly lump sprouting sensory tufts and black bulbous eyes seemingly at random, was equipped with trimember mandibles. from behind the head, like gill tendrils, extended two sets of three long, multiple jointed limbs. it moved very fast, only the lower two of the sets of limbs hitting the ground  --  the rest gripping at surrounding stalks to propel it forwards.

seeing the creature’s speed, and the rapid reaction of the dracoman diving from its path, Cormac realized he himself must move a lot faster to now stay alive. he located a long unused program in his gridlink and put it instantly online. his perception of time now slowed as his thought processes accelerated. the program simultaneously stimulated his body’s production of adrenaline. then he raised his carbine  --  but far too slowly. fire flared from his left, hitting the point where the creature’s legs joined behind its head on one side. it slammed into the ground ploughing up soil, the legs on its other side still gripping stalks and pulling down some of the sheltering leaves as well. now in bright sunlight, it tried to rise again. Arach hurdled over towards it in an instant, a particle cannon’s beam flashing turquoise between his pincers, and incinerating the attacker’s head.

[h|let’s keep moving], urged Cormac. he reached into a pocket on the side of his pack and removed a flat case from which he extracted one of eight short glass tubes, which he now inserted into his envirosuit’s med-access. A prickling at his wrists as the stimulants entered his bloodstream, an abrupt coolness, and then he began sprinting. Blegg and the dracomen kept up with him easily. he knew he must be the slowest moving among them. as he ran, he opened the bandwidth of his connection to Shuriken, now feeling as ready as he could be.

the dracomen spread out wider, and became difficult to spot as they resorted to their own natural chameleonware. they could only be seen at all because at this rapid pace their shifting skin patterns could not keep up to speed with their changing surroundings, and because their weapons and equipment could not be similarly concealed. the second creature did not even get close. glimpsing a shape speeding in towards them, Cormac initiated Shuriken and sent it spinning five yards out from his body, humming as it extended its chainglass blades, but the dracomen promptly fired upon the attacker simultaneously from three different directions. it body blew to fragments leaving only its limbs still clinging to nearby stalks. Arach scuttled inquisitively through this mess, Gatling cannons swivelling, then moved back into deeper jungle to one side of Cormac.

[h|aw, leave some for me], the drone called out to the dracomen.

it soon received its wish as a new type of beast joined the fray.

they kept running on, many other creatures attacking. proton and pulse-gun fire all around, Arach seemed to be everywhere, concentrating his huge firepower on grouped masses of the alien assailants, in the process bringing down swathes of jungle in burning fragments. the long-legged things could extend their heads, Cormac discovered, as he sent Shuriken hammering through one telescopic neck. the detached head landed beside a fallen dracoman, who rolled aside quickly and came upright to fire down at it, as the head now scuttled off on its mandibles like some independent beast. the target bounced briefly in red flame and then flew apart. Cormac recalled Shuriken and sent it skimming towards another such creature. premature action, as the headless body of the first one, still suspended in midair, extruded a long metallic tongue which wrapped around the dracoman and wrenched him back viciously. A strange groaning squeal ensued, then two separate halves of smoking dracoman hit the ground. Cormac fired his carbine, its flame meeting the tongue as it now shot towards him. Shuriken, almost as if angry about the dracoman’s death, hammered in and out horizonzally through its own opponent, then chopped up and down vertically on its return course. the creature fell to pieces.

Blegg, beside him, keeping pace. [h|seems they’ve decided we are the ones to be captured alive, and the dracomen are now dispensable].

[h|how many?]. Cormac asked.

[h|five dracomen down]. Blegg pointed at something weaving towards them. it resembled a long iron nematode hovering a foot from the ground, sliding through the air with the writhing of a snake. A red scythe of fire hit it in the middle, then two shorter versions of the same thing darted away. they both swung round on the source of the shot: a dracoman, clearly visible now since in using their camouflage there was too much danger of hitting each other in this fire-fight. One of the metallic things slammed into his chest, and with a sound like a cleaver striking a butcher’s block, pieces of dracoman and long shards of metal exploded in every direction. more and more Jain-factored creatures were coming in from every direction. A dracoman was snatched up in triple jaws, and the explosion of its carbine energy canister hurled Cormac to his knees. up again. left arm numb against his side where smoking shrapnel was embedded. pain-blocking program initiated, then firing one-handed into a nightmare head looming over him. Blegg slammed into his side, just as Shuriken came screaming overhead and straight into the creature’s mouth.

[h|up!]. Blegg spun him round, drew a carbide commando knife, and in one quick movement levered the hot metal from his arm. [h|not too bad], he observed

with movement returning to that arm, Cormac drew his thin-gun and fired off to his left with that, while simultaneously firing with the carbine past Blegg. the tracking and targeting program he was using was sending him cross-eyed. A <e>whumph</e> as a rod-ship crashed down amid them, crushing foliage and ejecting tendrils as thick as falling trees. Cormac saw another dracoman caught up as he himself concentrated fire on the deflating but spreading rod-ship. spearing towards him, the ground lumped up like a worm track. he aimed downwards just as tendrils exploded from the earth and wrapped around his leg. severing them with fire, he subliminally saw the captured dracoman slammed hard against the ground and discarded. not even a complete thought sent Shuriken whirring over above the dracoman while it shook itself like a dog and staggered upright again.

something else arced through the air, its source Arach, and its terminal whine familiar. Cormac ducked down as this missile landed amidst the spreading tendrils and exploded, spreading something like phosphorus across the ground. the blast seemed to propel Cormac through an area of new growth, where shoots like giant red asparagus speared up from the incinerated remains of stalks. he stumbled through a mass of red vines writhing under painfully bright sunshine, and out onto charred ground scattered with smaller blood-red shoots of new growth. dracomen emerged either side of him, then Blegg came stepping out backwards concentrating fire up into the face of some attacker. Arach came last, two cannons swivelling and targeting independently, the shots ripping into fast-moving silvery opponents, the flash of his particle cannon stabbing out regularly like a fiery tongue. without that drone, Cormac realized, this would have been over very quickly. he swiftly counted  --  eighteen dracomen surviving  --  then turned round to see mountain slopes ahead.

[h|I’ve got you now], came Thorn’s voice over com.

running down like silver dogs came four Polity autoguns. drawing close, they squatted obediently and poured violet fire into the jungle.
