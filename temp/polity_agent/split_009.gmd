<e>the Sparkind are an elite ECS military force, given a name derived from the Spartans (citizens of an ancient Greek city who were noted for their military prowess, austerity and discipline), though they cannot trace their ancestry back so far. Sparkind are rather the direct descendants of the Special Forces that came into being during the Earth-bound wars towards the end of the second millennium: the Special Boat Service, the Special Air Service, navy SEALS and the like. candidates for the Sparkind must first serve five years in conventional military or police service. their ensuing training program, both in reality and virtuality, is not designed to weed out the physically unable, because with today’s boosting and augmentation technologies, anyone can be physically able. but a certain strength of mind is sought: will, a toughness of spirit and a degree of wisdom. A Sparkind has to know what he, she or it is fighting for, has to be able to make life and death decisions, and has to be trusted with weapons capable of annihilating entire cities. operating in four-person units, usually consisting of two Golem and two humans, they have been involved in some of the most violent and dangerous actions the Polity has ever faced. but the Sparkind, though an elite fighting force, are usually never the first in. which brings me to the ECS agent, or Polity Agent</e> ….

 --  from her lecture [h|modern Warfare] by EBS Heinlein

the latest eruption dumped a layer of ash an inch thick, pocked with large spatters of cooling magma. Blegg stepped down off one of the ceramal beams glued in a gridwork across the Atheter artefact, stooped, and brushed away more ash. the cutting machines inevitably left swirls of stone stuck all over the surface since they had been programmed to hold back from actually digging into the object itself. however, some stone flaked away by itself to reveal translucent green crystal underneath. Blegg considered what all this meant.

this green substance was some form of memcrystal similar to that used in the Polity today. the most basic form of memcrystal  --  the sort that did not use crystal-interstice quantum processing, or etched-atom processing as it was sometimes called  --  could still store huge amounts of information. just a piece of such a memcrystal the size of the last joint of a man’s thumb could model the function of and store the memories of a human mind over a period of twenty-five years  --  though those who possessed memplants would upload more often than that just to keep their Soulbank copy up to date, thereby freeing up space in the crystal implanted inside their heads. if only of that kind, what could a single mass of crystal this size potentially contain?. the mind of a god?. the stock market transactions of an entire galactic civilization?. alien porn tapes and family albums?. Atheter blogs?.

with information technologies it was accepted that crap naturally expands to fill the space available  --  that recording media and the media it recorded always somehow outpaced memory storage. the whole new science of information archaeology was based on that truism. but this object was alien, so everything it contained would be new, unfamiliar and worthy of lengthy study. even information that would be considered dross in human storage would inevitably reveal things never before known about the constructors of this huge item.

Blegg stood up and looked around. the recent eruption streaked smoke across the lemon firmament, and a river of magma thrashed past some way to his left. he turned, remounted the beam and headed back towards his shuttle, which rested like a large grey slug on a rubble mound at the giant crystal’s edge. as he reached the beam end, a shadow fell across him. he glanced up to see the tug arriving: a manta-shaped behemoth.

he stood and watched as cables rappelled down from it, lowering spiderish grabs. these grabs hit the surface then scuttled along to grip large U-shaped lugs welded to the beams, then the cables drew taut. the entire artefact began vibrating  --  the gravmotors underneath it starting up. he stepped from it at that point, scrambling up the rubble slope to his shuttle’s airlock. inside he waited as a blast of frigid air brought the exterior of his hotsuit down to a manageable temperature, then opened his shimmer-shield visor as he entered the shuttle’s interior. he dropped into the pilot’s seat and studied the scene outside. the artefact was rising now, but the impression given was of his own vessel sinking. feeling the shuttle readjust its landing gear on the rubble below it, he engaged AG and lifted it a few yards into the poisonous air. soon the artefact became a black line cutting from right to left. fumaroles ejecting sulphurous gas clouded the view underside for a while, but that soon cleared to reveal the gravmotors attached beneath it. keeping his shuttle positioned to one side, Blegg followed the huge object up into the sky. other observers joined him  --  grabships from the station, telefactors, and floating holocams recording every instant of this ascent.

as the artefact rose through the acidic atmosphere it left a trail of ash and then, as the air pressure began to drop, volatiles complemented this trail with poisonous vapours. five hours later, when the artefact lay only a mile away from the <e>Hourne</e> , all the ash and volatiles were gone. the tug released its grabs, wound in its cables and drew away. now the grabships moved in to delicately clamp their claws onto the crystal rim. very slowly and very carefully, they eased the artefact through a gap in the <e>Hourne</e> ’s skin, and into a large enclosed space where shock-absorbing jacks closed in on its surface. even as Blegg brought his shuttle back round the giant ship, he observed suited figures and telefactors shifting plates of hull metal to weld into place and seal the entry gap.

when Blegg returned inside to stand at a viewing blister overlooking the artefact, the beams used to brace it were being removed and beetlebots were busy scouring the crystal surface of the last layers of accreted stone. around the internal chamber’s perimeter, multiheaded optic interfaces were waiting on telescopic rams ready to be pushed into position. back in the ship itself, haiman, human and Golem scientists, and the <e>Hourne’</e> s AI, were awaiting that crucial moment of connection with something of an alien race believed long dead.

 --  retroact 3  -- 

despite this place having been pounded into rubble, some remnants of the Reich here still fought on. the jeep lay sideways in the dust, its engine screaming and one rear wheel spinning madly, the driver’s headless corpse now draped over a nearby pile of rubble. A long spatter of blood linked vehicle to body. Herman  --  as he now called himself  --  walked a little closer to see if he could locate the head.

<e>ah, there</e> ….

it lay in the middle of the track bulldozed through the ruins, directly below the lethal wire strung across. as Herman moved closer he observed four German boys clambering down the pile of rubble to loot the headless corpse. they managed to get away with some chocolate, condoms, a wallet and an automatic pistol.

[h|there’s another one coming!]. shouted a fair-haired boy, and they all scrabbled from view.

Herman wondered if they themselves had set the wire, and if this ploy had really proved worth the effort. it never occurred to him to question how he could understand their language, any more than he questioned his ability to traverse the non-region of U-space around the planet. nor his intrinsic understanding of the events unfolding upon that planet. he was only a boy, yet he knew about that million-degree eye that had opened over Hiroshima. he was a boy yet he understood what had happened in that forest-bound camp where now the perimeter wires and posts lay bulldozed into heaps and the long sheds burned to ash, and where still a stinking miasma rose from the mass graves.

another jeep arrived. this time with an upright steel bar bolted to the vehicle, which snapped the wire just as the right front wheel rode over the previous visitor’s dusty detached head. the jeep turned and slid sideways to a stop, as the two passengers jumped out cocking M2 carbines. Herman stepped away, half a mile this time, to reappear just outside a courthouse. A little later an American gave him chocolate, peering with a puzzled expression at his asiatic features. over the ensuing weeks Herman tried copying such expressions, concentrating on manipulating the muscles in his face. only after the judges arrived did he realize, after seeing his reflection in a shard of mirror, how unreasonably successful he had been. thereafter he unwrapped the filthy bandage he had bound around over the top of his head and running underneath his chin.

getting inside the courtroom was not possible at first, but he picked up so much by just listening and lurking around. in this way he learned about the film to be shown as evidence. upon hearing instructions given to the guards about having to put out the lights, he managed to transport himself inside at precisely the right time. no one there noticed him: their eyes riveted to the screen and many of them quietly crying. he wept then for his parents, for the horror of the world, and for the lot of a humanity he no longer felt a part of. and with a wholly adult relish he sometime later transported himself to a spot nearby to watch a stiff old gentleman in a baggy uniform, climb with shaking legs some wooden stairs to have his neck snapped at the end of a rope.

 --  retroact ends  -- 

after detaching her carapace from the interface sphere, Orlandine stepped out of it and headed aft, through the living quarters, through a hold space packed with equipment, and into a storage chamber for haiman tools. she needed more than one set of hands for this job, and that’s where they were available.

within the chamber, four assister frames were racked. ignoring them for the moment she found a lightweight spacesuit adapted to haiman requirements and donned it, then she approached the first of the frames. this contrivance hung in its rack just like a spider carcase fashioned of silvery metal. she backed into the body space designed to accommodate her carapace, felt the numerous locks and optic plugs engaging, and her own control software coming online. One arm, human in length and terminating in four fingers, came up underneath her right arm, locking soft clamps above and below her elbow and just above her wrist. now, essentially, her right arm possessed eight fingers  --  four of them metal. the pseudo arm that now connected to her left arm terminated in a three-fingered clamp over a micromanipulator and s-con and optic interface head. pseudo limbs simultaneously clamped themselves down each leg. these terminated in large three-digited claws protruding backwards from her ankles, which were usually used to anchor a haiman in place while working in zero-G. folding out at a point just above her midriff were two additional arms, terminating in hands each with two opposable thumbs. she extended one of these out in front of her, wiggling its metal fingers. now she was totally haiman.

this transformation was a psychological thing, related to ego and self-image. with just her carapace engaged, though her mind became larger and more extensive  --  capable of processing information like an AI and able to handle multiple tasks  --  it only extended from the two-legged two-armed ape. the next step was opening her sensory cowl. the moment she did that, the ’ware loaded to handle multiple sensory inputs: she could perceive radio, infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, detect complex molecules in the air …. but still she remained psychologically no more than a human using tools; peering through a nightsight, binoculars, whatever. but the assister frame’s ’ware undermined her self-image in a way that seemed integral to her being. her metal fingers were as touch-sensitive as her organic ones. she knew their position, their relation to each other and to her own soft self; her micro-tools were sensitive to textures not far above the atomic. she became the goddess Kali and the all-seeing Watchmaker combined.

<e>am I insane?</e>. some part of her wondered. but it was a very small part indeed.

initiating detach, she stepped away from the support frame, then scuttled insectlike to the airlock. once outside she clung to the hull and looked around. with her cowl spread, her surroundings seemed as bright as day from the residual infrared emitted from the ship’s thrusters and the further fluorescing of complex ices nearby.

the cell she had entered was a hundred yards across, its six walls nearing sixty feet high. Orlandine pushed herself from the hull and dropped slowly towards the floor. making contact with it, she began walking away from the ship with a steady floating gait. in a moment she realized that the low gravity here would prove an inconvenience. if she moved everywhere like this, it would take her forever to get anything done. using the enhancement of her legs she leapt forwards, hitting one of the walls ten yards up but absorbing the shock through her other enhanced limbs. as she dropped down beside the wall surface she studied it contemplatively, turning to look back at the <e>Heliotrope</e> only as her feet connected with the floor. this chamber she would prepare first for the rapid escape of the ship, and perhaps in time she could convert it for her own comfort. she would pressurize it and insulate it, maybe move out of the ship itself. in the wall behind her she would cut a hole and construct an airlock, and the cell beyond would then become her laboratory. that would be perfect. the Jain node would sit between clamps right in the middle of it: the focus of every resource she could muster.

Aphran considered the facts of her life, if it could be called that. even though she was a second generation recording of the original Aphran, a sentence of erasure hung over her because of the crimes that original one had committed. no claim of being a changed person, of having understood the error of her ways, of now being prepared to actively support the Polity, would change that. Aphran had murdered people, hundreds of people, and nothing she could now say or do would bring them back. her sentence remained suspended only because ECS currently found her knowledge very useful, and because she had become intertwined so closely with Jack that her erasure might damage him in the process. but Jack was slowly untangling himself from her, and her usefulness to ECS was decreasing. she was a dead woman, and felt sure she would soon be a non-existent one.

tracking Freyda as she came aboard, Aphran recognized another walking dead woman. their captive wore a security collar which could paralyse her in a second, or blast a toxin straight into her carotids. she strode with a kind of arrogance, ahead of the bobbing telefactor, and Aphran knew Freyda probably thought she could get through this using just nerve and lies. soon she would have to wake up to reality. Jack had appointed Aphran to the task of administering the cold shower.

[h|and not a krodorman in sight], Aphran murmured.

[h|Aelvor’s people have yet to make a search], Jack replied, [h|but none are listed in crew or on any passenger manifests of arrivals within the time frame].

[h|they won’t find any], interjected Thorn, over com from the planet below.

[h|perhaps you could explain, Thorn?]. Aphran enquired though, knowing Freyda, she knew what Thorn’s answer would be.

Freyda looked up and around, almost as if hearing part of this com exchange. impossible of course. perhaps she wondered why Aphran had not come to greet her the moment she boarded. when she eventually found out why, that would be the first shock.

[h|there <e>was</e> no krodorman. that’s why you found no krodorman DNA at the scene. I’ll bet you found syntheflesh at von Hellsdorf’s place that’ll match samples in the hotel. she simply wore a krodorman suit …. by the way, Aphran, what’s your history with her?].

reluctantly she replied, [h|she recruited me to the Separatist cause on Corolon].

Aphran and her two sisters were each born from different fathers, but that was nothing unusual in the Corolon arcologies. she remembered the three of them playing together in the enclosed arboretums, in the shopping malls and sometimes in the rooftop fields. but best of all were the secret places of the sprawling city: the tunnels and niches, the air ducts and hollows through which spread forests of cables and pipes. it probably all started with them when the latest game became [h|break it and see how quickly the robots can fix it’. enger obtained an electric saw with ceramocarbide teeth, and not being the most incandescent lightstrip on the block, she found and cut into a superconducting cable. there seemed little point sending what remained to the crematorium. Aphran and Arial then blamed the robots. Arial, the eldest, was caught destroying three welding robots, and, while pursued by monitors, fell down a ventilation cavity. she survived but, after they bone-welded her skull back together she was never quite the same again: never wanted to play those same destructive games any more. Aphran believed the AIs had tampered with her brain. so when, a few years later, Freyda approached Aphran to recruit her to the Separatist cause, she knew she had at last found her place in the universe. only in later years did she realize that after fighting for the cause for so long, a love of death and carnage had displaced Freyda’s initial idealism. Aphran now recognized the blindness of her earlier self: Freyda representing what Aphran herself had become before her physical death.

the cell Jack had prepared for their prisoner was unfurnished, deliberately claustrophobic, the lighting too bright. if Freyda wanted to sleep, or even just sit down, the cold ceramal floor would have to suffice. as the door closed behind Freyda, Aphran allowed the woman a little time to contemplate her present situation.

[h|no reservations?]. Jack asked her, coldly dispassionate.

[h|none at all], she replied, trying to believe that completely.

machines first, just like those she had destroyed as a child, but now she was working with more effective tools. Freyda taught her all about explosives: which ones to use in what situations and how to maximize their destructive effect. Aphran learnt impatiently  --  she wanted to do something soon about the injustice done to her two sisters. obviously it was all the fault of the AIs. why wasn’t that s-con cable adequately shielded?. why no safety nets in that ventilation space?. why didn’t these godlike AIs look after people?. at the age of seventeen she killed her first monitor. he had fancied her, so was not sufficiently on his guard. she shot him once through the throat, again through the back of the head as he lay gagging for life. then she spewed up her guts nearby. the organization got her out of there  --  she’d left just too much of her DNA as evidence at the scene. on another world she graduated to mass murder with a bomb planted in a runcible facility, but it failed to take out the AI there. the only AI she ever managed to actually …. kill, was a free Golem, and that at close range with a missile launcher, while its back was turned. but though the AIs were the main enemy, the most hated of all were those who willingly served them: ECS and its agents  --  no agony could be too much for them to suffer. how utterly and completely did the Separatist organization brainwash her, and how downright stupid of her to allow it.

Skellor  --  the brilliant biophysicist who was promising to change their fortunes  --  brought ECS down on them like an avalanche. subverting an ECS dreadnought by using Jain technology, he then made Aphran and some of her fellows his crew in the most horrific way possible: subsumed in Jain tech, becoming mere adjuncts to him, suffering and yet not dying. then he killed her, burned her in a never-ending fire, the only escape being for her mind to flee inside the Jain structure. next came Jack, who uploaded her from there to a partitioned segment of his own crystal. she combined with him, embracing him for the sake of her own survival, and there found clarity with which she began to see everything thereafter. for open to her were the massive historical files that Jack contained, giving sharp contrast to the peace and plenty enjoyed across the majority of the human Polity. she saw how the AIs allowed the human race the freedom to enjoy luxurious eternity, or even to destroy themselves personally, but not the freedom to destroy each other. she came to recognize her past life as the stubborn intransigence of a spoilt child. but most importantly she saw Jack. and that alone was enough.

[h|I wondered why you were not prepared to die for the cause, but you did not answer me], she enquired over com.

Freyda shook her head, then sat down with her legs crossed, her back resting against the wall.

[h|only when I see you, will I believe it’s really you], she replied.

Aphran chose an image matching her appearance when held captive aboard the <e>Occam Razor</e> , and projected it into the room.

Freyda frowned and waved a dismissive hand. [h|projection. I suppose whatever is talking to me now was constructed out of information reamed from Aphran’s mind before they killed her].

[h|Skellor killed me. you remember Skellor, don’t you?. he actually burned me to death].

again the dismissive hand gesture.

Aphran allowed her form to change into that now more commonly seen by those aboard the <e>NEJ</e> . this elicited more of a reaction, Freyda’s eyes growing wide. she stared for a long moment before shaking her head.

[h|I am a memcording  --  that’s all of me remaining], Aphran told her. [h|is this what <e>you</e> would like to be?. you have information that may be vital and you are surrounded by people who are very much lacking in patience. they’ll use an aug to interface with your mind, make a copy of all it contains, then that recording will be taken apart by this ship’s AI. you personally will then be of no use. this cell can easily be opened to vacuum].

[h|you’re no Aphran I know. you would have died rather than serve them].

[h|but I did die].

Freyda grimaced and stared down at the floor.

Aphran went on, [h|this is an Aphran with her eyes opened wide. <e>your</e> cause is hopeless, pointless and destructive. but then I think you came to realize that even before you recruited me. once you genuinely believed all that humans-to-rule-humanity crap, but in the end you just enjoyed your own sense of importance …. and killing people of course].

[h|if I do talk, what do I get in return?].

[h|whatever we can give you, but within reason].

Freyda snorted contemptuously then said, [h|I would rather like to stay <e>alive</e> ].

[h|is that within reason?]. Aphran shrugged. [h|hard or soft  --  your choice. from here you’ll be transported back to Earth, which will require about fifteen runcible transfers. there you’ll face a judicial AI and be sentenced for your crimes. this does, however, mean you’ll live a little longer].

the fifteen transfers were the key, for Freyda would still believe there might be a way out of this for her. Aphran only felt sad when registering the furtiveness in the woman’s expression.

[h|I want to be allowed certain freedoms during that time], she said. [h|I don’t want to be put into coldsleep].

[h|granted].

again that look of furtiveness. [h|I’ll need time to think about this …. in a better location than this. I am not an animal to be caged].

Aphran allowed herself to begin to fade. [h|you have no time].

[h|okay], said Freyda quickly. [h|okay …. what do you want to know?].

[h|how many of you were there, down there?].

[h|I’m not entirely sure --]

[h|how many?].

[h|seventeen …. fourteen now].

[h|their location?].

Freyda eventually volunteered a grid reference deep in the forests.

[h|there is something there], Jack informed Aphran. [h|it’s shielded, but not sufficiently so].

[h|now], said Aphran, [h|what brought you <e>here</e> ?]. she gritted her non-existent teeth through the ensuing political diatribe, and kept asking the same questions until Freyda provided the true answer.

[h|high level ECS agents to kill  --  that’s always attractive].

[h|how did you know they would be here?].

while she waited for the answer, Aphran listened in on coms traffic both within the ship and way below, as the shuttle down on the surface, containing Thorn, Scar and fifty dracomen, launched on a heading to the coordinates just revealed.

[h|I was told]. Freyda abruptly stood and eyed Aphran up and down. [h|is that how you appear now, the princess, the lady in white …. one of the good guys?].

[h|it is how I <e>like</e> to appear].

[h|perhaps you’ve forgotten Coloron, then. Thellant N’komo still runs things there, and it’s him you need to talk to. where he got his information from I don’t know, but it was him that sent us here].

Aphran allowed her image to fade totally, then, as an afterthought, sent the signal that paralysed Freyda. the Separatist woman dropped like a pole. Aphran observed as the door now opened and the telefactor entered, carrying the aug they would use to record Freyda’s mind and check the veracity of her story.

[h|do we ship her back to Earth?].

[h|no], Jack replied.

[h|kill her?].

[h|no].

[h|what then?].

[h|sentence was passed on Freyda long ago, should she ever be caught. death or erasure to be carried out as soon as feasible after her capture. after I have taken a recording of her mind, checked her story, and gleaned from it all knowledge that might be useful to ECS, I will wipe the recording and then wipe her mind. we will put her body into coldsleep, as there are still plenty of minds in the Soulbank who would be grateful for the physical vessel].

and that being how the Polity dealt with its criminals, Aphran felt die then any hope she harboured for a future.

the scene now surrounding Thorn vaguely reminded him of his time as a soldier. inside the shuttle the ten dracomen squatted in pairs in their saddle seats, their weapons braced across their chests. but these were soldiers of a different stripe. when they first landed on the planet, Thorn asked Scar why they discarded their impact suits. the dracoman leader had replied that they did not wish to be encumbered. Thorn then suggested they clad themselves in chameleon-cloth fatigues. Scar demonstrated how their own skin was much better at the job. so now, but for harnesses on which to carry high-tech weapons and other equipment, they were naked: green scaled all over except for their fronts which were yellow from throat to groin. with their forked tongues tasting the air, sharp white teeth occasionally exposed, they seemed like extras in a barbaric scene out of some VR fantasy.

in the cockpit Thorn faced forwards as Scar brought the shuttle down low so that now, through the ceiling-to-floor front screen, they could see the forest hurtling along underneath them.

[h|how long?]. he asked.

[h|sixteen minutes].

Thorn nodded. it had been difficult, but he managed to force himself to delegate this mission to Scar  --  just giving the dracoman the simple instruction:

[h|try to kill as few of them as possible  --  we’re here for information, not extermination].

[h|how many prisoners do you want?].

[h|I leave that up to you, Scar].

Scar banked the shuttle slightly, and took it lower, forest now speeding under its left-hand side. opening his pack Thorn removed a plastic box and popped it open. as Scar straightened the craft again, Thorn took out one of the small camcom discs and passed it over to the dracoman, who inspected it for a moment before slapping it on the side of his head. closing the box, Thorn tossed it to the next dracoman behind him. he did not need to say anything more as dracomen were very far from stupid. the first took out a disc, pressed it to its temple, then passed the box on. now Thorn operated the lever to bring his seat closer to the mission-control console. he lifted the VR headgear from its recess and placed it over his head  --  the visor covering his face and phones enclosing his ears. immediately frames began accumulating across his range of vision as each dracoman pressed a camcom into place. using the ball control in his chair arm he selected frame one in the sequence. it expanded to fill his vision and the sounds within the shuttle changed slightly. he now seemed to be looking through Scar’s eyes, and hearing what the dracoman heard. clicking back, he saw all the frames now present, and a diagnostic readout showed the system to be working at optimum. Thorn removed the headgear and placed it back in its recess.

the view remained largely unchanged for ten minutes more, then Scar brought the shuttle down lower still so it sped along a straight lane between looming walls of trees. below, three tracks, each five yards wide and spaced forty yards apart, had been crushed through a dense tangle of bluish bracken, parsleys and brambles. soon they came in sight of the massive machine responsible: the beetle-shaped agrobot was two hundred yards long and a hundred wide, and mounted on three sets of three huge cage-ball wheels, which enabled so massive a machine to manoeuvre with remarkable accuracy. but it was going nowhere at the moment, since two of the cage balls had collapsed. Scar swung the shuttle in a wide circle around this behemoth, checking the ground below with infrared and carbon dioxide emission scanners. but nothing showed up, and Thorn wondered if Aelvor had yet started introducing large animals  --  or if he ever would. perhaps he did not like what creatures like deer might do to his newly planted saplings.

after this survey, the dracoman finally brought the shuttle down directly behind the mechanical colossus. even before the shuttle landed, its side-ramp doors began to open. dracomen started disembarking the moment a wide enough gap opened; leaping fifteen feet down into the vegetation as if the drop was nothing to them. as soon as the shuttle settled, Scar unstrapped himself and stood up from his saddlelike seat. Thorn stood also and followed him out into the bracken. here the dracomen only became visible when they moved  --  their scales transforming in both colour and texture to match their surroundings. dressed in simple green fatigues, Thorn himself was the only one clearly visible. then, as if showing sympathy to him, all the dracomen simultaneously returned to their natural colour.

[h|remember], said Thorn, [h|we want to take some of them alive].

Scar wrinkled his lips away from sharp ivory in a manner not exactly reassuring, then made a spearing gesture with his hand, and they set out. with their high-stepping birdlike gait the dracomen easily picked their way through the thick-growing brambles and bracken, then slowly they began to fade as they once again began to camouflage themselves. Thorn stood and watched them go, and really wanted to follow, but realized that would be pointless.

landing directly on top of the Separatist encampment would remove any element of surprise, since the shuttle’s arrival would be detected long before. this highway for the massive agrobots was the nearest place to the encampment for a shuttle to find a plausible reason for landing. Aelvor had somehow caused the agrobot to break down at this point, so anyone listening and watching would think their shuttle contained a maintenance crew. it was a good plan since, on foot, dracomen could cover the intervening terrain very quickly. Thorn, being very fit and physically strong, and possessing reserves at their maximum, could also have covered the forty miles of forest easily enough, but in his case it was a question of how fast. he remembered once running with Scar through the foothills of the Masadan mountains, hunting a hooder on which they intended to plant transponders so that the monstrous predator’s location would always be known. their pace then had been an even jog, and Thorn had thought it time they picked it up a little.

[h|can you go any faster than this?]. he had asked the dracoman on that occasion.

Scar fixed him with that big-eyed gaze, [h|can you?].

Thorn accelerated until he was running full-pelt along the stony trail. he glanced at Scar and saw that the dracoman’s pace seemed almost unchanged, yet still he kept up.

after a moment Thorn said, [h|show me, then].

One moment Scar was loping along beside him, the next moment he took off like an ostrich, kicking up wet shale as he accelerated. Thorn watched him go, tracked him moving further along the path, then turning left up the slope until soon out of sight. after about five minutes he heard something approaching to his rear, and glanced back to see the dracoman speeding up behind him. Scar again settled to that jogging pace beside him.

[h|in miles per hour?.’thorn had asked.

[h|ninety to a hundred …. on level ground], Scar replied.

[h|okay, maybe we’ll stick to my pace for now].

it was a chastening memory.

Thorn now returned to the shuttle, donned his VR headgear, and began selecting views to observe. soon the dracomen moved from tangled growth to clearer ground below the trees. they picked up their pace and became more visible as their skin failed to compensate fast enough to the changing surroundings. then, again almost as one, they returned to their natural coloration.

[h|Scar], he said over com, [h|let me know when you’re about to attack. I’ll then launch and head over towards you. that might provide further distraction].

Scar’s reply was merely a grunt, whereupon Thorn decided to shut up, sit back, and enjoy the show. A half-hour more of forest scenes resulted in him impatiently removing the headgear to go in search of a tab-pull coffee from the shuttle’s supplies. returning to his seat and replacing the helmet, the first thing he heard was Scar’s voice: [h|we attack].

Thorn spilt his coffee, swore, then quickly called up the feed from Scar’s camcom: pulse-rifles firing through the trees, shots stitching across a thick trunk, momentary glimpse of an autogun bolted to another trunk, an explosion, a tree falling. Two figures, human, a blurred shape between, and the double thump of stun discharge, two figures falling wrapped in small lightnings. tents: chameleon cloth. stun fire. A turbine winding up to speed somewhere. Thorn flicked through views, caught a glimpse of an AG scooter slamming into a tree. another view: a man firing his weapon at the dracoman through whose camcom Thorn watched, muzzle-flash, flame and smoke then foliage and sky, then the dracoman was abruptly back upright again as the man turned away. A stun discharge threw the man down on his face. then back to Scar, walking now.

[h|we are done].

Thorn sat very still, checked the time display in the corner of his visor, then shivered involuntarily. so much for his idea of launching the shuttle as a distraction. abruptly the entire range of frames before his eyes then froze.

[h|Scar cannot hear us], said Jack. [h|observe this].

without Thorn doing anything, his VR gear selected a frame and the scene it displayed went into fast reverse, froze, then played forwards. he watched a man swinging his pulse-rifle round and begin firing. the shots slammed into a dracoman’s chest, juddering it to a halt then flinging it back. the man swung away to aim elsewhere. from a prone position the dracoman flipped forward and upright, fired on the man and brought him down, then it ran on. half its chest was missing, the resultant cavity smouldering.

[h|I’m glad they’re on <e>our</e> side], whispered Thorn.

[h|if they really are], replied Jack.
