<e>prador -- human War: this intense conflict lasted for forty years. warships were destroyed in such numbers that some worlds acquired ring systems formed from the resultant debris. ten million humans (this estimate is considered low and it might really be as high as fifty million) were infected by a virus on an out-Polity planet called Spatterjay, which enabled them to withstand severe physical injury, then were cored (most of the higher cerebrum removed) and thralled (the cerebrum being replaced by Prador enslaving technology) and sold to the Prador by a human called Jay Hoop. in one incident an entire moon was flung through an enlarged runcible gate to destroy one of the heavily armoured alien dreadnoughts, and in another a sun was stimulated to produce a solar flare to fry a similar vessel. armies of humans, Golem and baroque and slightly mad drones numbering tens of millions fought for possession of worlds against similar numbers of Prador first- and second-children and Prador drones (not controlled by AI but by the preserved brains of the aforesaid children). many worlds were bombed with antimatter explosives, or fission weapons, scoured by particle cannons, hammered by near-c rail-gun projectiles. some were burnt down to the bedrock and utterly denuded of life. billions died</e> <e>on both sides. it could be claimed that the Polity won, for the Prador withdrew, but the aliens were not truly defeated. fifty years later those same ring systems and denuded worlds became tourist attractions, as did Spatterjay itself, but now, nearly a hundred years later, interest has waned amongst the Polity’s growing population. some even believe the data on this conflict, easily accessed just about anywhere, is fiction, or just a hoax perpetrated by the AIs</e>.

it sat in interstellar space like a giant harmonica; forty miles long, twenty wide and ten deep, the square holes running down either side of it were the entrances to enormous construction bays. massive weapons turrets protruded from it out into space: housing racks of missiles as large as attack ships; thinking bombs whose prime purpose had been to fight their way to exotic-metal hulls and detonate; particle-beam cannons gaping like cavern throats; rail-guns that could fill nearby space with swarms of ceramal projectiles travelling at near-c; lasers, grasers, masers …. nearby space had once been also patrolled by chameleonware sneak mines, but they were decommissioned after becoming too much of a shipping hazard  --  their minds unstable and bored with waiting for an enemy that would never come.

[h|I knew about this sort of thing], said Cormac, [h|but still …].

[h|you were born about when it ended, weren’t you?]. Mika asked. she stood unusually close, he thought. he could smell her scent, realized she used Eyegleam and Shade, and her lips were now dyed a redder hue than her own. he read the implicit message, but did not know if he should respond.

he shook his head, feeling slightly uncomfortable, [h|no, I was eleven years old when it ended. I grew up while secrets were still being kept, and I had been working for ECS for twenty years by the time the AIs felt it safe for some of them to be revealed. by the nature of my work I already knew more than most, but was surprised even then].

Mika grimaced. [h|so you are what …. just over a hundred years old?].

[h|solstan time], Cormac agreed, [h|but personal time about ten or so years less than that. I’ve spent a lot of time in coldsleep between missions].

Mika nodded, shrugged her acceptance, then pressed a hand against the panoramic screen as if she wished to touch the vast construct. [h|there’s seven more of these stations still mothballed. you know, most Polity citizens cannot quite grasp the scale of that conflict  --  just what a mobilized interstellar civilization can do]. she turned, shrugged. [h|it’s been like that ever since war was industrialized]. she gestured behind her at the screen. [h|this place was built in only three years and churning out dreadnoughts, attack ships and war drones just about as fast as the construction materials could be transmitted in. it could not keep up with demand during the initial Prador advance, since on average one medium-sized ship got destroyed every eight seconds during that conflict].

[h|but still we won, in the end], said Cormac.

[h|won?].

[h|well, we survived, which had not been the Prador’s intention].

[h|the new king of the Prador made the right decision to withdraw. had they continued they would have lost completely, but as it was they retained some autonomy].

Cormac smiled to himself. Mika knew this subject and was extremely interested in it. all these facts, available to him with a thought, were now common knowledge: casualty figures, number of worlds burned down to the bedrock or obliterated, the stories of moonlets fired through enlarged cargo runcibles to take out Prador heavy dreadnoughts, the abominable coring trade out on the Polity rim  --  how Prador enslaved humans in their millions. but it was now history, and as such seen by many as not quite real, not really anything to do with them.

[h|why did Earth Central choose this place as an Isolation station?]. she asked.

<e>To business</e> , he thought.

[h|no other place large enough and isolated enough. Two more of these places are also being used. so far there’s over eight million people aboard this one].

[h|not nearly enough  --  we should have gone straight to Coloron].

Cormac shook his head. [h|the runcibles are closed to incomers for the duration, and it would take four months by ship even at <e>Jerusalem</e> ’s top speed. by the time we got there it would all be over one way or another].

[h|so what is the plan now?].

[h|you, D’nissan and all the others stay aboard the <e>Jerusalem</e> and continue doing what you do best: you study Jain technology and learn what you can from Dragon. Jerusalem predicts that after the initial rush to the runcibles on Coloron the pressure will drop off. in the inevitable lulls, ECS Rescue and military personnel will be transmitted through. I intend to go through then to link up with Thorn]. he glanced at her. [h|Jerusalem is holding off until the situation on Coloron has been clarified. if required, this ship will make the jump to there. if not it will head back to either Cull or Masada].

she mulled that over for a while, then nodded. Cormac could see her torn between undertaking field work on Coloron and continued research here on the <e>Jerusalem</e> with its huge resources. probably what inclined her not to ask to come along with him was the mile-wide being which hung in space nearby, only a few tens of miles from the <e>Jerusalem</e> . Dragon now accompanied them. its manacle, no longer containing CTDs, was no longer a manacle at all. this had been a test. had Dragon fled, then some doubt would have been cast on its testimony. it did not, and continued to assist the researchers aboard this ship.

[h|how long until you go across?]. she nodded at the screen.

[h|when I’m ready. I need something from Jerusalem first].

she nodded again, then gave him a long assessing stare.

[h|by the way, how is your research progressing?]. Cormac asked.

Mika moved away from the screen and sat on his sofa, curling her legs up beside her. [h|we are learning a lot, and very quickly. we will, within days, have developed a system to prevent physical Jain-tech takeover of the human body, though it won’t prevent the subject being killed. next we’ll be working on a doctor mycelium similar to the one I used before]  --  Mika looked uncomfortable  --  [h|only one that won’t try to grow Jain nodes and thus kill its host. Dragon has offered to give us these items complete and in working order. Jerusalem refused  --  it does not want us using anything we don’t fully understand. so now Dragon is feeding us the schematics piecemeal].

Cormac did not feel very good about that somehow. was it really the case that to survive in the universe humanity must cease to be human?. already transformation had occurred  --  augmentation, boosting, adaptation, the haimans  --  and this now seemed yet another step in that direction. if all this present furore led to some allout conflict against something that was just a thing, just a hostile technology that required hosts, could it be, that if they came out the other side of it, they would be indistinguishable from the Makers?. transformed into something less admirable despite their victory?. he winced  --  of course that supposed humanity was something to admire.

[h|how are you progressing?]. Mika asked.

Cormac paused, about to ask what she meant. but a certain honesty, integrity, made him close the impulse down. the conversation was about to progress away from the business at hand, and he repressed the urge to abandon it. he sat down on the sofa next to her.

[h|physically I am in good shape but bad condition], he said.

[h|curious description].

Cormac smiled. [h|everything is healed, everything is there, but my bone and muscle mass is low. presently I’m on regrowth factors, steroids, and induction stressing of my bones while I sleep]. he gestured vaguely to the door leading into his sleeping area. [h|it will be weeks before I’m back in condition].

[h|and your mind?]. Mika asked, leaning closer.

[h|fragile, Jerusalem tells me. apparently, the last time I asked, I have a tendency to over-focus on the task in hand, with an exclusivity that is borderline autistic].

[h|but isn’t that how you have always been?. I’ve worked with you intermittently, for some years now, yet I know very little about you. how do you relax  --  do you socialize, do you have family?. with you it has always been the job and nothing else. but I know there’s more …. Chaline for example?].

Cormac felt he wanted to get up, draw this encounter to a close …. run away. he repressed that urge too.

[h|we had a brief liaison at Samarkand, that was all. I was damaged goods then as well  --  too long gridlinked and apparently losing my humanity].

[h|no inclination to continue where you left off?].

[h|the <e>Celedon</e> survivors are heading back to Solsystem].

[h|that’s not what I asked].

[h|<e>none</e>].

[h|what about your family?].

[h|are you trying to psychoanalyse me, Mika?].

[h|no, this is what is called social intercourse. you might have encountered it before on those occasions when you weren’t shooting someone].

Cormac could feel something twisted up inside his chest. exercising rigid control, he chuckled. [h|my family …. my father was a soldier who did not come back from the Prador War, my mother is an archaeologist, on Earth. I have not seen her in forty years. I have two brothers who work in the ECS medical service. I have not seen them in forty years either]. he waved a hand towards the window. [h|they might even be here, I don’t know. perhaps we all possess the same narrow focus on our own interests which is why our ways parted. there’s a network family site that I check occasionally, and last time I looked I learned I now also have a sister-in-law, two nieces and a nephew, a grandniece. also, thirty years back I acquired a stepfather, then a half brother and half sister …. shall I go on?].

[h|no contact at all?].

[h|none. isn’t it the case now that even when a nuclear family is formed, which is not often, its members tend to drift away?. we move about a lot more now, and we’re long-lived so there is less desperation to cling to that centre. yourself?].

[h|I am an orphan and have never been able to trace my family. I don’t even know if they are alive. it’s why I take such an interest in other people’s families, and don’t quite understand the lack of interest I often encounter].

Cormac shrugged and stood.

[h|should I leave now?]. she asked.

he walked over to the drinks cabinet, reflecting that he still could not quite get used to the luxury this vessel provided. fashioned of something as near to old oak as made no difference, the cabinet was supplied with all types of glasses, a selection of drinks in glass and ceramic bottles, and even contained an ice machine plumbed into the wall. it also possessed a programmable drinks maker concealed behind the lower wooden doors, which was operable by a touch-console inset in the glass top. via chrome spigots this could provide anything from hot coffee to yak-buttered tea.

[h|I would like you to stay], he said, picking up two brandy glasses cut from manufactured emerald  --  probably made aboard this ship. [h|brandy?].

[h|please].

he uncapped a bottle, poured, turned with the two glasses to find her standing facing him. she took her glass, sipped, stepped in close to grip the front of his shirt in one hand and pulled his face down into a kiss. with her pressed up against him, he suddenly became much more aware of her as something more than Mika in Medical, Mika explaining Jain tech, cell-welding wounds, and dissecting alien flesh. she stepped back, looking almost angry. he sipped his drink.

[h|don’t you pull away now], she warned.

he pursed his lips, turned and deposited his glass back on the cabinet. [h|it seems I have to take you out of that neat little box in my mind now and reassess you].

[h|I’ve got a better idea], she said, stepping past him to place her glass down beside his. [h|let’s just cut all the cerebral crap and get physical. you can do a reassessment afterwards, maybe build some programs to analyse the Mika pheno …].

he slid the back of his hand down her stomach, pushed his fingers into the top of the loose slacks she wore, pulled her close and kissed her hard to shut her up, then towed her behind him towards the sofa. by the sofa she broke away from him, slid a thumb into the stick-seam of her slacks, slid them down, kicked her way out of them.

[h|get undressed and lie down], she ordered.

Cormac found no problem in obeying this authority figure. she wore no underwear and was quickly astride him, though still wearing her loose oriental top. grabbing his penis she slid her hand up and down  --  <e>now I’m in charge</e> . after a moment she shuffled forwards and, easing herself down with a hissing exhalation, began gently to revolve her hips. he closed his eyes, tried to remember the last time he’d let anyone get this close  --  so many hurried sexual encounters organized when they could be fitted into his schedule, last time on Elysium while he awaited the end of the quarantine imposed there; the rest of the time using drugs to repress the need, control it, like he controlled every other aspect of himself.

[h|don’t you dare come], she ordered, stripping off her top, [h|not yet].

[h|would you like to tie me down to this sofa?]. he joked.

[h|not right now], she replied, [h|I hardly know you well enough for that].

Cormac laughed, then felt shocked  --  wondering when was the last time that had happened too.

Thorn brought the AG platform down opposite a burnt-out shopping centre and eased it in over a tangle of ceramal beams flaked and distorted by the heat. twelve dracomen occupied this platform with him, while Scar and eight others occupied the platform immediately behind. he looked around him. the chainglass windows of the shops remained intact, but were blackened from the inside. burnt bodies lay on quartz paving, black and curled foetal. A low-walled garden, running down the centre of the shopping mall, still smouldered  --  all the smaller plants incinerated, though jagged cores of cycads still stood. he swung his platform over to the right of this garden while Scar took his to the other side.

[h|okay], Thorn spoke into his comlink, [h|we’ll land up at the end here and see what we can find. Scar, have your people spread out and cover the landing area  --  not too far mind, we might have to get out of here fast].

at the end of the mall stood a row of drop-shaft entrances, with a corridor leading away on either side. Thorn swung the platform over near a bar beside the entrance to one corridor. most of its furniture was scattered but a table and three chairs still stood upright. grotesquely, one chair still supported a charred corpse slumped over the table.

the dracomen moved fast once the platforms landed. Two of them headed up the adjoining corridor, three covered the drop-shafts, and all the rest, except Scar, spread out to form a protective perimeter. Scar came over towards him.

[h|where would you suggest?]. Thorn asked, eyeing the dracoman intently.

[h|it is all around us], Scar replied.

Thorn listened. he could hear creakings and shiftings as of wreckage settling and cooling. there came a faint scuttling sound, too, like rats in the walls. he scannned around and located, just inside the corridor entrance, a row of public-service terminals. [h|over here]. he led the way.

each terminal consisted of a simple touch-console and screen. Thorn propped his proton carbine against the wall, drew his thin-gun and blew a hole in the wall beside one of the screens, then jammed his fingers in beside it and pulled. the flimsy screen tore out of the wall, revealing only the optics behind. no sign of anything unusual there. he holstered his gun, took hold of the wall panel immediately below the screen, wiggled it back and forth then tore it free: more optics, branching off from a main duct, to the console above. he was gazing at this junction when he heard the distinctive sound of a chair scraping back.

proton fire flashed like summer lightning through a ruby. he glanced aside to see the dracomen firing at something further down the corridor. pulse-gun fire stitched across the wall above his head. the single alfresco occupant of the bar stood up, pulse-rifle braced at the hip, then disappeared in a flash of red fire, tumbling back in pieces amidst tables and chairs blasted to fragments. other figures began appearing, weapons firing, dracomen moving to counter them. then, tentacular new growth began sprouting from the incinerated gardens. Thorn took in all this in a brief glance, reached down and grasped the duct cover, tore it away. bundled optics behind, but something else as well: grey vines and fibres packing every cavity, silvery tendrils that shifted slightly. he snatched the memstore from his pocket, already extruding a nanofibre interface from one of its end ports. he selected one of the thicker, unmoving vinelike growths and pressed the interface head against it. immediately hairlike fibres extruded and penetrated, bonding the memstore in place. but other silvery fibres then began whipping from the bundled optics, surrounding the interface head, spreading up around the memstore itself.

Thorn snatched his hand away. <e>damn</e>.

he pulled back, taking up his carbine, turned and squatted. the dracomen easily held back the human-shaped attackers, but they were not all to be reckoned with. he saw a tendril spear up from the floor, punching through it like a bullet, whipping twice around a dracoman’s legs, then penetrating his chest. no time to try retrieving the memstore, no way to find out if the HK’s penetration had been successful.

[h|go!. go!]. he bellowed.

they ran for the platforms. Thorn boarded one first, lifting it a few feet from the floor. Scar leapt on behind him. A dracoman tried to raise the other one, but something held it down. the dracoman leapt free, just as a mass of tendrils fingered over the edge.

[h|here, <e>now</e> !]. Thorn shouted, holding his platform in position. Scar opened fire on substructure spiralling out of the wall towards them. Thorn saw the impaled dracoman being lifted, struggling, up into the air. A shot from one side cut that tendril at floor level. the dracoman dropped and, as if wrestling with a snake, pulled it from his body and was up and running in a second. Thorn tilted his platform and sent it planing towards the trench cut down through the arcology. the rest of dracomen converged fast, firing on growths all around them, leaping up and cramming themselves onto the platform. just as the last one leapt on, their weight seemed too much, for the platform jerked downwards and skidded against the floor. A red flash and it rose again, something writhing like a nematode around one side rail, until a dracoman blew both it and the rail away. more groping, snakish movement: the shopping precinct looked like a cave filling up with tree roots.

as Thorn slowed the platform to weave his way between the twisted ceramal beams, two humans leaped aboard. pulse-gun fire into Scar’s stomach, the other one wielding a jag of metal like a sword. instant reaction: the man with the pulse-gun hurled straight over the side, the other opened neck to crotch with his own weapon  --  close combat with dracomen being worse than the kind engaged at a distance. Thorn glimpsed the second man slumping back against the rail, his gaping torso fast closing and filling up with pinkish growth, bloodless, before a couple of dracomen hauled him up and flung him over the side. neither of the humans had uttered a sound.

out into the particle-beam-cut gap, things uncoiling from the wreckage all around, still groping for the AG platform which lurched under its heavy load. then Azroc’s forces opened up and they planed off through a cavern of fire, smoke and ash belching all around them. when finally they landed, troops quickly surrounded them, the presence of the dracomen assuring them no Jain tech had been brought across. Thorn noted how Scar showed no signs of damage, though he had taken at least three shots directly in the stomach. the dracoman penetrated by a Jain tendril stood for a while with head bowed, with two others of its kind watching it carefully. eventually it straightened up and looked around, whereupon the other two moved off unconcerned.

[h|well, that went well], said Thorn. what a complete and dangerous waste of time.

just then, Jack’s voice issued from his comlink.

[h|I have just received a signal which, knowing its source, I handled with some caution …. the hunter-killer program is in, and it is searching for Thellant N’komo].

Thorn whistled, grinned.

Two big transports were down  --  titanic landers resembling the inverted hulls of ocean liners  --  a third still hovered in the sky, casting a massive shadow. Thorn scanned back towards the arcology with his monocular. it was as if someone had punctured holes in an enormous tin can and fluid ran out. increasing the magnification, it now seemed he saw ants flooding from a nest. higher magnification still and the monocular began whirring as it adjusted its lenses to compensate for shake. now he truly saw the hundreds of thousands of people, family groups or individuals, loaded down with belongings or trailed by hover luggage. antigravity platforms and gravcars manned by ECS troops or monitors hovered over these crowds. yet it all appeared surprisingly orderly outside. there had been some sporadic shooting, but that was unsurprising with such a mass of humanity to control.

To one side a line of AG platforms and gravtransports flowed like train carriages. these contained the injured, and those wearing Dracocorp augs who were now stunned and sedated. tracking this line of traffic out, Thorn focused on the motley collection of ships gathered beyond the large landers. the badly injured or ill were being stretchered to a twin-hulled H-ship dispatched by the medical arm of ECS. beyond this, domed tents spread like a rash of blisters on the landscape almost to the horizon. still other ships were scattered amid all this: some privately owned vessels, smaller hospital and rescue ships, or smaller landers sent down, from a couple of old passenger liners still in orbit, to bring supplies to this rapidly growing refugee camp.

[h|what are the figures now?]. Thorn lowered the monocular.

via Thorn’s comlink, Jack replied, [h|Coloron informs me that the runcibles here have been kept open-port to the Isostations for a week. capacity sixty thousand every hour, but it rarely reaches that. eight million in that first week. Runcible technicians have moved fast to set up another five runcibles on a less populated world undergoing terraforming. the population there is low, about ten million. Earth Central made the calculation that risking ten million lives there, it might save many more from here. EC is also opening up more of the big shipyards to turn into Isostations and Coloron has brought three more runcibles online here. nearly twenty million via that route thus far].

[h|what about that liner?.’thorn enquired.

[h|the <e>Britannic</e> can take aboard fifty thousand. its landers can take up to about five thousand at a time, so it will very soon be full].

[h|spit in a rainstorm], muttered Thorn, watching one of the landers launch. just contemplating the figures involved was nightmarish. in two weeks the AI had managed to move off-planet only two per cent of MA’s billion population. One per cent a week at the present rate. Two solstan years minimum, to accommodate them all working on that basis, it was hopeless. [h|anything else?].

[h|other ships are arriving, including a dreadnought within a few days. this means a wider area can be covered by orbital weapons. Coloron has extended the perimeter, as you can probably see from where you stand. that reduces the evacuation time here, considerably. had we two weeks to spare, we could get most inhabitants clear of the arcology].

[h|how long <e>do</e> we have?]. Thorn asked.

with a cold exactitude, Jack replied, [h|being optimistic: one week. by then the Jain substructure will have spread throughout the entire arcology, but it will reach the runcibles before then. and before then it’ll be subsuming those still remaining inside].

letting his monocular hang by its strap around his neck, Thorn gripped the rail tight. he felt sick. as a Sparkind trooper on Samarkand he had witnessed the results of a catastrophe in which 30,000 died. on Masada and its surrounding cylinder worlds, and in <e>Elysium</e> , that figure rose to a million. here, already, the estimated number of deaths exceeded 100,000. A week?. maybe another 10 million through the runcibles, and maybe half the surviving population safely outside the arcology. what then?. Thorn’s problem was that he knew precisely [h|what then’. the moment Jain tech got close to the runcibles, they would be blown. at some point Coloron or Earth Central would declare the risk of Jain tech spreading planetwide too high. the calculation would probably be made to a hundred decimal places. then MA would be incinerated down to the bedrock. unless the projection changed drastically, there would still be half a billion people remaining inside. the magnitude of it was unbearable.

[h|still nothing from the HK?].

[h|no, nothing at all].

the sun was shrouded in the cloud generated by the titanic destruction of the Cassius gas giant, though that fug occasionally revealed drifting structures, glittering scaffolds of pseudomatter, immense space stations and swarms of vessels  --  all evidence of the massive million-year construction project taking place here. the ship surfaced from U-space one astronomical unit out, and travelling at three quarters the speed of light, it used ramscoop to decelerate: opening out orange wings radiating from the abundant hydrogen being dragged in around it, soon followed by the sunbright ignition of a fusion drive. this vessel bore none of the sleek lines of other Polity ships, seeming more like some ancient vehicle’s engine block, greatly enlarged and transported out into space. it was in fact mostly engine: a leviathan tugboat for hauling moon-sized masses. the arrival of such a ship here at the Cassius project being a common occurrence, it was merely noted by the humans, haimans and AIs directly concerned with it, and slotted into the vast calculation of construction as a nail might be slotted into a similar calculation for a house. just a few noted, and dismissed, the slight discrepancy between ship and U-space field. fewer still observed the other object that came through with it and rapidly veered away from its course: it was too small, too inconsequential seeming in a project of this scale.

this second object was thirty feet long, curved like the head of a spoon, in colour silver-green fading to black at the edges, and bore patterns like umber veins in its surface. it clawed at the very fabric of space to decelerate in a way Polity physicists and AIs were only just beginning to understand, and implement. as it slowed, its chameleonware initiated and made it invisible throughout most of the radiated spectrum. its insides were packed like the guts of some nematode  --  though with organs seemingly silver-plated when not of the same grey-green metal as the hull. sunk inside this, and connected to it, the Legate scanned all signals, comprehended the underlying U-scape, viewed information just as it viewed the growing scene before it, angrily.

firstly, she had obviously not yet made any physical contact with the Jain node. that was annoying but acceptable, and factored into the calculation. but thereafter she had not reacted as predicted by all the psyche tests and cerebral assessments. she was extremely intelligent for a buffered amalgam of human and AI, but still a loner, a power seeker, and asocial. feeling trapped and constrained by the Polity she should have grasped at all the Jain node implied, for she had known nothing of its parasitic/destructive tendency. she had delayed and delayed until forewarned. but even that should not be unconscionable.

Orlandine’s arrogance should have been such that she would believe herself able to control the technology despite its revealed purpose, use it, grow and become godlike  --  discarding what she did not want of it in the process. that had been Erebus’s initial assessment, for the AI itself only later had discovered the layering of Jain tech’s depth of purpose. it was made to fool intelligent, borderline supernal, technical but  --  most importantly  --  arrogant beings. she should have taken the bait. by doing so here, she would by now have taken over this entire Cassius project, spread vastly around the sun incorporating all nearby sentients, all the stations and ships and the giant puzzle pieces of the incomplete Dyson sphere. from here, while she still maintained control, she would have used the numerous runcibles to spread out into Polity, subsuming worlds, stations, incorporating AIs. weaving the Polity into the whole it should be, and reducing human beings to what they essentially were: flesh puppets. at the peak of spread she would then have discovered just how effective a weapon was the Jain node  --  being made for individuals like her, and civilizations like this. perhaps some of the Polity might still have survived.

not enough.

but even all this was not what angered the Legate most; only its inability to understand did that. it could not comprehend why it had been sent here. aboard, it carried one more Jain node destined for a Separatist leader actually located within Earth’s solar system. coming here to find out exactly what had happened endangered that mission and statistically raised, by an unacceptable amount, the chances of the Legate being discovered. what was Erebus thinking?. disconnected from that entity for so long, the Legate could not now know. but neither could it disobey.

the Legate located the construction station initially overseen by Orlandine. shutting off all drives and dropping its ship’s systems to minimal function, it drifted in, cautious. now it began delving into the AI network and, as expected, found hunter-killer programs leashed like attack dogs around any information concerning Orlandine. the Legate knew it could destroy them, but doing so would reveal too much. other methods would have to be employed. drifting in closer it observed the damage to the station, enclosed under a shimmer-shield, ran programs to assess its cause, but could learn little from that: a fusion explosion  --  the degree of devastation commensurate with the output of an interface sphere power cell. its hypocentre was not precisely at the location of Orlandine’s sphere, but much of hers had also been destroyed. what had happened here?. Polity AIs must suspect this to be no accident, hence the hunter programs. the Legate constructed and discarded scenarios. perhaps Orlandine began her takeover and some other haiman learnt of it in time to destroy her  --  that other haiman sacrificing himself and others in the process?. no, the informational takeover would be too fast. really, there was only one way to find out.

using minimal power, the Legate nudged its vessel towards the near edge of the shimmer-shield, for fewer sensors would be active there after having been damaged by the explosion. its ship turned concave side down to hull metal that had been rippled into waves by the blast. the vessel injected nanofilaments to bind itself in place  --  still invisible to most forms of detection. then came a shifting of the vessel’s inner components. it heaved like some animal vomiting, split along one side, and the Legate slid out turning its feet down to the metal, stood up, bonding with the similar nanofilaments, and walked. momentarily the Legate became visible while detaching from the ’ware effect of its vessel, but then its own ’ware came on and it faded from existence again. stepping to the edge of the shimmer-shield it peered inside.

Two ant-shaped drones clung to twisted metalwork and emitted pools of light in which two human women clad in monofilament oversuits worked. the women were scanning and sampling physical evidence. One of them wore an aug; the Legate lightly touched then pulled away from this nexus of the AI network, learning the other woman to be gridlinked. it considered going in there, disabling the drones, and snatching from the humans whatever it could. too intrusive, too obvious. anyway, the Legate needed more than just the physical evidence; it needed anything informational which, by the fact that these two worked in here now, would have already been removed to be scanned and assessed by forensic AI.

the Legate turned and strode away across the hull, eventually stopping by a service lock constructed for inspection drones. scraping sharp fingers across the hull it scanned through  --  ultrasound by touch  --  and soon located the control mechanisms. A low leakage of atmosphere behind this hatch enabled it to trace out the shape of a service robot lurking inside, like a trapdoor spider. it pressed its palm flat over the control mechanism, injected filaments, each tipped with a micron diameter thermic lance, burnt through the hull, connected, and then feeding power from inside itself operated the mechanism. the hatch thumped up, a slight puff of air escaping, and slid aside. the maintenance drone immediately came online, its lensed sensory head tilting upwards. the Legate reached down, grabbed for it, pulled it out and smashed it down on the hull, once, twice, stabbed a hand through its outer casing and gutted it, located its small crystal mind, crushed that to glittering fragments, then sent the drone on its way into vacuum.

once inside, the Legate wormed through maintenance ducts and finally came up against inner hull. it placed a finger against this softer material, injected a single microfilament equipped with a cutting head, bored through, then discarded the head in order to online the filament’s optics. now an inner maintenance shaft. forefinger and mid finger together, extending bladelike to twice their original length, were blurred along the inner edge by the activity of thousands of microscopic teeth. the Legate pushed its fingers through the wall and cut round in a circle, fast, a cloud of powdery detritus spraying all around. the excised section of wall blew towards it under air pressure. the Legate slid through pulling the removed section back into place. breach sealant automatically ejected from the wall itself to seal the cut line. an alarm would sound somewhere but, because the sealant had dealt with the problem only a maintenance drone would be sent. the assumption would be of a micrometeorite puncture. by the time they discovered any different, the Legate would be gone from here.
