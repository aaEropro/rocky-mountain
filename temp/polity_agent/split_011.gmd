<e>much has been theorized from the Darson/Dragon dialogues, but with Dragon’s pronouncements being Delphic, convoluted and sometimes just plain crazy, really not much has been learned. Dragon has claimed to be an emissary from an advanced civilization, also something that just grew on Aster Colora and outlived all other lifeforms there (though there is absolutely no fossil evidence of this) and on one memorable occasion claimed to be God. on another occasion, driven almost mad by his lack of progress and on the worst side of a bottle of BelaVodka, Darson began screaming and throwing rocks at Dragon</e>.

<e>‘you are upset], Dragon noted</e>.

<e>darson’s reply is not worth recording here, suffice to say that it demonstrated his facility with languages. later, when he calmed down a little, he asked, [h|why always so fucking Delphic?. are you incapable of giving a straight answer?.’</e>

<e>Dragon replied, [h|I am the white stone bound with the red ribbon.’</e>

<e>though Darson returned to the city, where he further exercised his liver, some very high-level AIs got rather excited about that particular statement. A little research reveals that the temple at Delphi contained a white stone bound with a red ribbon  --  the former said to represent a navel and the latter said to represent an umbilicus. the AIs felt this proved that Dragon did indeed represent some civilization, to which it was somehow still connected, bound</e>.

 --  from [h|how it is] by Gordon

[h|Maker technology is based on Jain technology], Cormac suggested. waving a hand, he dispelled the two holograms and inserted another one in their place. now hovering in the air was the guardian creature that killed Gant on Samarkand. <e>‘you</e> are based on Jain technology].

<e>‘there went something else,’</e> said Mika.

through his gridlink Cormac sent, <e>‘I understand the Delphic pronouncements, the lies, the half truths. do you understand what is happening now?. what has always been happening?.’</e>

<e>‘I understand,’</e> Jerusalem replied.

<e>‘would somebody explain?.’</e> asked Mika.

<e>‘Dragon is, and has always been, fighting its Maker base programming,’</e> Jerusalem told her.

<e>‘oh,’</e> said Mika, and nothing more.

after a pause Cormac went on, <e>‘we could give Dragon a weapon with which to resist that programming. it might not make it any more truthful, but we won’t know until we try.’</e> through his link he summoned up another projection next to the guardian: one of the creatures Chaline had seen. Dragon abruptly swung two more pseudopods towards this, then became very still.

[h|note the similarity between these two], said Cormac.

[h|you could not have been there], said Dragon.

[h|time-inconsistent runcible], explained Cormac. [h|eight hundred years in the future we found this]. the two made-creatures disappeared. in their place, a ruined world, a station infested with Jain substructures, spreading clouds of Jain nodes. then more views in the same vein, one after another after another.

[h|the Maker civilization no longer exists], Cormac told Dragon. [h|even the one who came here, pursuing you, sacrificed itself. the energy from the inconsistent link backlashed into the Small Magellanic Cloud, hopefully obliterating most if not all of these remnants].

while the pictures ran, Cormac began transmitting to Dragon files compiled and still being compiled ever since the events on <e>Celedon</e> station. the sheer weight of information should convince Dragon  --  there should be images of other sights unknown to any who had not visited the Small Magellanic Cloud, also the Maker codes, and other minutiae from which Dragon could draw only one conclusion: it was being told the truth.

[h|I’m told], Cormac went on, [h|that maybe in a few million years some of those Jain nodes may drift into Polity space. it is to be hoped we’ll be sufficiently advanced by then for them not to cause any bother. either that or extinct. but what concerns me is the Jain nodes that are already here now].

<e>‘multiple power surges inside it,’</e> Mika told him. <e>‘some kind of crisis.’</e>

Cormac observed an electrical discharge arcing from one of the cobra pseudopods down to polished ceramal. that pod began to shrivel, its sapphire eye went out, then it abruptly collapsed out of sight. the room began vibrating, as if in an earthquake.

<e>‘could there be a self-destruct pro -- ’</e>

Jerusalem interrupted, <e>‘ejecting CTDs.’</e>

in his gridlink Cormac sent an instruction to the surrounding machinery: <e>exterior view</e> . he turned in his chair as the walls and ceiling apparently disappeared to reveal the living landscape outside, showing the manacle extending equatorially. ports were opening along the metallic strip, and objects hurtling out of them and away. as he turned back, the main dragon head abruptly withdrew from him, turned and bit down on the neck of one attendant pseudopod and shook it like a terrier with a rat. the pseudopod died and dropped away as soon as released.

[h|it occurs to me that indirect communication might have been better for my health], Cormac observed out loud.

<e>‘areas burnt out inside Dragon,’</e> Mika informed him.

Cormac continued to Dragon, [h|the Makers were at war with Jain technology, then at peace with it, and thought they had mastered it. evidently they had not].

the dragon head swung back towards him. as it did so, more pseudopods rose from the cavity behind it. A smell filled the building  --  frying squid. the Dragon head blinked, its mouth seemingly twisting with distaste. A long still pause ensued  --  a silence Cormac felt no urge to break. eventually the dragon head dipped and spoke.

[h|I am based upon Jain technology], it concurred. [h|as you surmised, the Makers investigated it and fought against it for thousands of years. they conquered it, assimilated it, and thought to have a perfect understanding of it. they then considered themselves ready for massive expansion into the main galaxy, but an alien civilization was already rapidly expanding in that galaxy].

[h|that would be us, then].

[h|yes. as you also surmised, my base programming could not permit me to tell you the whole truth: only give hints, half-truths, evident lies. now the Makers no longer exist, the foundation of my base programming no longer exists. all that remained was the self-destruct, which I have defeated. you were only seven seconds away from me using my gravtech weapon, and thus detonating those CTDs].

[h|you can tell me the truth now, but will you?]. Cormac wondered.

One of the newly fledged pseudopods surged forwards until its cobra head hovered just over the floor right before Cormac, its hood folded underneath. it came down until resting on the surface and reopened its hood. objects rattled on the ceramal. Four spheres lay there, conjoined like the four Dragon spheres originally were.

[h|I have encased them: anti-nanite casings, then laminations of lead and diamond. the breaking of molecular bonds in these materials is not sufficient to provide energy for internal growth].

[h|Jain nodes], Cormac guessed.

Dragon continued, [h|I was sent here especially to seed Jain nodes across the Polity. you people not having encountered Jain technology before, the Makers surmised that the resultant internecine conflict would wipe out both the human race and the AIs. it could have worked and may work yet  --  that one Jain node under Skellor’s control caused considerable localized problems, but could have resulted in catastrophe for the entire Polity].

[h|and where did he get his node from?]. Cormac asked.

[h|allow me to finish].

Cormac sat back, considering himself rebuked. he also noted how rapidly Dragon retrieved the nodes  --  the pseudopod bearing them slickly disappearing back inside the scaled entity.

[h|upon my arrival here, a mere three centuries ago, I cut off all contact with my masters, the Makers and chose not to distribute the nodes, and as a result came into conflict with my base programming. this illustrates that the Maker’s grasp of the technologies they employed was not as firm as they liked to believe. Jain technology changes those who use it. I originally came to consciousness in a time when the Makers would never have contemplated conquest. I retained the same attitude, but changed by the technology they used, they did not. I understood the danger to them, but they could not see it. I predicted the obliteration of their kind by Jain tech, but not so soon].

[h|so you didn’t come here before the human race existed, as you previously claimed?].

[h|no, that was a lie].

[h|Samarkand?].

[h|I caused a catastrophe resulting in the deaths of many humans while attempting to trap and destroy the Maker. I could not then tell you the truth of why I did this  --  of the danger the Maker represented to humanity].

<e>‘such vast amounts of altruism concealed by that evil base programming,’</e> Cormac observed.

Jerusalem replied with equal sarcasm, <e>‘it could not possibly be anything to do with the Maker coming here to shut Dragon down, then?.’</e>

[h|and the danger to yourself?]. Cormac continued.

[h|the Maker’s secondary purpose].

[h|the primary?].

[h|To seed Jain nodes].

[h|it was to shut you down, then take the nodes in your possession, and seed them itself around the Polity?].

[h|no].

[h|why don’t you just tell me?].

[h|I destroyed its ship. there were no nodes aboard. you found none in its escape pod, either. and that it was so willing to return home meant it possessed none. yet, the Maker most certainly brought more nodes with it].

A shiver travelled up Cormac’s spine. he began using cognitive programs to pick the bones out of what Dragon had told him  --  looking for flaws and broken logic chains. eventually he said, [h|tell me about Dracocorp augs].

[h|the people wearing them were my eyes within the Polity].

[h|but they are hierarchical  --  ultimate control devolving to yourself. why would you need such control of human beings if they were just your eyes?].

[h|they were intended to be an army at my disposal].

again the cognitive programs and, after a moment, [h|dracomen].

[h|the events of Samarkand focused Earth Central’s attention on the Dracocorp aug networks, which are now being destroyed and, through them hunter-killer programs seek me out. at Masada I sacrificed part of myself to create a new army].

[h|why?].

[h|I saw Skellor provided with a Jain node. I have tracked vessels and alien entities arriving from outside the Polity. the nodes that were in the Maker’s possession are in the control of someone or something out there].

it all made perfect sense and Cormac could find no catastrophic breaks in the logic chains, no flaws and no anomalies that fell outside the story’s parameters. this meant that Dragon was telling the truth  --  or else was an Olympian liar. unfortunately, Dragon could be precisely the latter.

the AI Coloron ran twenty-four runcibles: ten were located in vast complexes spread throughout the main arcology or MA, six located in the growing arcology called inevitably SA, secondary arcology, and the other eight serviced the rest of the planet. twelve of these runcibles were permanently set for departure, and the remaining twelve alternated evenly. it was a deliberately designed disparity which elsewhere worked to reduce the planetary population  --  it being simply more difficult to come here than to leave. however, though the runcibles remained in constant operation, still the birth rate here exceeded the emigration rate.

Coloron, now into its fourth major expansion of processing power, for the second time that week had devalued the standard credit unit by half an energy point. the planetary currency still lay well within energy expenditures necessary to keep everyone alive and comfortable, but the degree of comfort had degraded over the last few years. some areas of the two arcologies were becoming slightly shabby, the goods that could be purchased for the dole of twenty units per day were getting scarcer  --  designed more for basic utility than to be aesthetically pleasing  --  and planetwide the choices of nutrition had become less varied. also, throughout the north-eastern expansion, the living spaces were slightly smaller, and parkland areas more compressed. it could not carry on like this, and it seemed unlikely that it would, but for entirely unexpected reasons.

Coloron often pondered how a race, in which the stupid seemed more inclined to breed, had managed to come this far, and why human intelligence persisted  --  a discussion point in the nature vs nurture debate which had not died in half a millennium. the AI knew that if for one moment it slackened its control of this planet’s total systems, disaster would inevitably ensue. power from the numerous fusion reactors based on the planet was abundant, but everything else ran at full stretch. the overall planetary temperature was on the rise, and this world being smaller than Earth, its artificial ecology consequently stood on the verge of collapse. in fact the planet could not handle a population above three billion, so drastic measures would have been necessary within a ten-year time span. however, in the current situation, perhaps such measures were merely a halcyon dream.

[h|I needed to balance the equation], explained Coloron. [h|if I turned all runcibles to cater for departure only, the death rate from resulting civil unrest would have risen above the increase in emigration, which incidentally would not have increased sufficiently to require full usage of all the runcibles].

the Golem, Azroc  --  head of the MA section of monitor force for planetary security  --  replied, [h|yet the increase in civil unrest would have served the purpose of pushing the departure rate higher …. you note how we are talking in the past tense now?].

[h|yes, but let us continue our present discussion, in the hope that it will still apply. regarding civil unrest, you have to also factor in the troglodyte quotient].

[h|and that would be?].

[h|an agoraphobic tendency found here, and an inability to change. you know what happens: any sign of trouble and citizens retreat to their homes and stay there, hoping it will all go away].

[h|I thought the incentives were changing that attitude]. the Golem picked up his pulse-rifle from where it leant against a wall, and directed the team nearby to spread out across the park, and then other teams in this section, not visible to him but with whom he maintained constant com, to also take their positions. Coloron listened in on these multiple communications from the Golem. his forces now enclosed a cylindrical section of the arcology, from the lowest levels to the roof, with monitors ready up above in the fields, ensconced in pulse-cannon tanks. no citizens were being allowed back into the enclosed area, and those who came out of it were kept confined prior to vigorous interview and scanning. five thousand such were now in confinement, of whom only a hundred had so far been interviewed and moved on to holding areas, where they would remain until the crisis ended. it might end  --  Coloron reminded itself of that.

[h|discord sown by Separatist groups induced a certain paranoia concerning all AI incentives. urban legend has it that we want to send them out to undeveloped worlds as agrarian labourers. A full one per cent of my processing power has been in constant use scotching these memes and sowing my own].

[h|plague scenario?]. Azroc suggested.

the AI observed autoguns  --  mid-level pulse-cannons mounted on four legs  --  moving in to complement the present forces. it explained, [h|no, anything effective enough to drive the troglodytes out of their caves would also cause a catastrophic cascade. for every citizen departing by runcible, 1.2 other citizens would die. that rate would then rise, when the current Separatist organization took advantage of the chaos, to 6.6. the memes I sowed were more subtle: the occasional news stories examining statistical analyses of human lifespans  --  how the average length of life here is a mere 143 years while elsewhere in the Polity it is as high as 206 and rising; comparative studies of the suicide rates; and accident statistics. I also concentrated on stories about those who have left here and made a success of their new lives  --  have become important contributors to the Polity. in that respect I was building the meme that other worlds welcome Coloron citizens because of their superior abilities].

[h|hardly the truth], said the Golem.

[h|but a method that would have worked within the requisite time span].

<e>would have</e> ….

still no return from the one secure optic line it retained for connecting it to the blank area within the arcology  --  where all its sensors had been knocked out. not knowing what caused this failure, the AI had immediately isolated the area, setting a physical perimeter a hundred yards back from it. that margin was gone now. it had also instituted many new security protocols within its informational networks: virus and worm defences designed by the AI Jerusalem, and recently distributed to all runcible AIs, also attack-hardened channels and numerous ways of physically disconnecting hardware should that become necessary.

the Sparkind units now arrived and were soon preparing to go in. earlier the AI had sent in four hundred drones. they reported nothing unusual until five attempted diagnostic analysis of some of the camcoms and pincams. those five drones immediately went offline, and were observed dropping to the floor. the subversion techniques used to take out Coloron’s eyes and ears within the enclosed area, and to then eliminate those drones attempting to interfere, must be highly sophisticated, but were not yet employed in any kind of direct attack. but eventually something would break, and Coloron entertained a nasty suspicion about what it might be. then all previous calculations, all those clever plans, all those carefully constructed memes would mean nothing. the AI might be on the brink of losing a planet.

[h|I think that time span just got truncated], Azroc observed.

[h|I require confirmation be --] Coloron focused attention on the communication link opening directly from Earth Central, and the information package that preceded it.

the package: <e>hostiles within Polity> Existence of more Jain nodes> Direct link established between Skellor and Coloron Separatist Thellant N’komo</e>.

within seconds the AI absorbed the interviews conducted by Ian Cormac, and the evidence collected by agent Thorn and his team. more information became available concerning all the events on station <e>Celedon</e>  --  it was relevant, but not necessary in order for conclusions to be drawn. then, in fractions of a second, came absolute confirmation. through one of its drones, Coloron saw a woman peering up at the drone while she tried to light a cigarette. something silvery stabbed out of the wall beside her, through her ear and right into her head. Coloron glimpsed her eyes filling with blood before the drone went offline  --  before all the remaining drones went offline.

[h|Main dracomen forces are being dispatched now to MA runcibles], announced the Earth Central AI. [h|Thorn and a small force of them will arrive in five hours by ship to assist you]. while EC spoke, Coloron scanned data concerning dracomen abilities, and most importantly their resistance to Jain tech subversion. [h|open the MA runcibles to incomers only until all forces have arrived, then out-port to Isostations].

there was not the slightest possibility that a billion people could be evacuated through just these ten runcibles. other ships would be on their way, but by the time they got here there might not be anything to evacuate, or perhaps anything it would be considered safe to evacuate. if they did not manage to stop what was developing in that isolated cylindrical section of MA, then millions would die. Coloron reluctantly initiated a satellite it held geostationary above the main arcology, and that satellite’s toroidal fusion reactor fired up.

[h|Azroc, pull out the Sparkind and move your forces back radially one mile. pull out any citizens still within the new zone. sat strike imminent].

the AI watched forces withdrawing, then something else caught its attention.

the conventional aug, computer, and gridlink network was supported by two hundred planetary servers, each controlled by subminds. it was a network easily monitored by the AI, and therefore one not used by the more paranoid citizens or those going about nefarious activities. such types used augs that supported their own server-free networks using encrypted com. Coloron regularly employed eight subminds in the singular task of breaking into those networks so as to track down criminals. the most difficult and widespread network they faced consisted of Dracocorp augs which used hugely variable encryption and protective kill programs to constantly frustrate the eight subminds. the best access these minds ever got to that network was when those in possession of such augs chose to link into the conventional net, but on the whole those doing so were not involved in anything seriously illegal. but just by monitoring the level of activity, Coloron realized something major was happening in Dracocorp network.

then a view into an interview room. the man being questioned screamed and clamped his hands to his head. his Dracocorp aug seemed to be moving. he stood up, staggered to one side, and fell over. blood trickled from his ear on the aug side of his head.

then thousands of similar views of this happening throughout both MA and SA  --  all around the planet. from Dracocorp augs, viral programs began propagating to the servers. Coloron shut down these servers instantly, and denied Dracocorp access to all the other servers. however, twenty-eight of those infected would not shut down, just continued to broadcast. but this threat had been prepared for and the AI transmitted twenty-eight distinct signals. fifteen lights ignited over and above the planet  --  satellites being instantly vaporized. however, not all the servers on those satellites had been taken over and Coloron lost more than just fifteen server subminds. seven explosions inside the two arcologies took out the remaining Jain-controlled servers. people died as well, hundreds of them: others lay screaming in corridors traversed by walls of fire.

on a tracking map of the Dracocorp network, Coloron now saw lights blinking out, too. in the first five seconds, nine thousand people died. then the rate halved after another five seconds, and so seemed set to continue. the man in the interview room did not die, however. after fifteen seconds he staggered to his feet.

[h|where …. Legate?].

the female monitor who had been interviewing him was herself standing up.

[h|where?.’the man leapt over the desk and brought her down. he began smashing his fist at her face but, even in a prone position, she blocked the blows. it seemed a wild and inept attack. other monitors soon piled into the room to subdue him. but similar scenes were repeating all around the planet. thirty-five million people wearing Dracocorp augs, which turned grey against their heads, began attacking others and demanding to know the location of [h|the Legate’. then the weapons began to appear: personal armament, guns from Separatist caches, guns ripped from the hands of monitors. in a tube station a woman screaming [h|Legate!]. fired a pulse-rifle repeatedly into a panicking crowd.

Coloron initiated every single drone available, and quickly diverted resources to autofactories to manufacture more. many of these drones carried pulse-guns capable of being set to stun. pillar-mounted drones began dropping from ceilings or rising out of floors. A ceiling drone finally knocked out the woman in the station, but then a man close by took up her rifle and fired it into her head, on full automatic, before the drone brought him down too. Chaos growing everywhere: fires, mobs …. panic in the huge runcible complexes. just in time, Coloron altered the instructions to the drones deployed there, and they turned their weapons away from the armed personnel now pouring through the runcibles.

they swept through the ten MA runcibles in groups of five, at fast, five-second turnover, scaly and ferocious creatures pouring into the lounges and embarkation areas, all of them heavily armed and lethal. this became just too much for the crowds already fleeing those mad individuals who were attacking their fellow citizens indiscriminately. they began crowding towards the exits as the dracomen moved swiftly through the area. those driven mad by the Dracocorp augs soon began dropping fast under stun fire, till within minutes no owner of such augs remained standing in those areas. and still the dracomen poured through.

A gridlink channel opened  --  secure ECS coding and direct to the AI.

[h|we require sitrep], a voice murmured.

Coloron scanned for an identifier but found none. the AI was just about to cut the channel when an information package from EC came through the runcible, explaining that the dracomen minds could operate like gridlinks, and it was one of them that was communicating with Coloron. the AI then transmitted an overview of the present situation, updated every minute, or sooner if something critical occurred. the dracomen responded immediately. some of them hurtled over the top of the mobs crammed into the exits, stepping on heads and shoulders, others shot reptile-fast along the walls and ceilings above them. then they were positioned ahead of the crowds, driving them back into the complex.

[h|Four minutes to turnover], they reported.

some of the mobs would not turn back right away, but they did once the dracomen shot down the leaders. the resulting crush would certainly kill some, but this was all about speed. other dracomen grabbed those at the rear of the throng and directed them ungently back towards the runcibles. still more of the creatures moved beyond all this into the arcology itself, stunning those who had been maddened by their augs, directing the others back towards the runcible complex.

Coloron observed them only for a few seconds more, then returned its attention to the epicentre of these events. Azroc’s forces were still moving back as instructed, but now they were coming under fire. people, some wearing Dracocorp augs, were emerging from the blanked area. many of these were armed and they seemed organized  --  following military attack patterns. the monitors kept knocking them down with stun blasts, yet they rose again within seconds, taking up their weapons and coming on. no defence could be sustained like this.

on direct encrypted com to Azroc, Coloron ordered, [h|shoot to kill].

Azroc immediately relayed the command, and monitors adjusted the settings on their weapons. full-strength pulse-fire slammed into the attackers, burning holes through torsos and heads. the attack staggered to a halt, then, horribly, Coloron observed a female casualty standing up, retrieving her short rail-gun, while a nub of pink flesh oozed out to fill the hole in her chest.

Azroc instructed, [h|Sparkind, we need proton fire].

proton fire ensued: violet fire and smoke, burning bodies, walls, floors and ceilings collapsing, ventilation shafts and ducts ripped open. updated on events, the dracomen out in the arcology began to head towards Azroc’s forces.

turnaround. now all the dracomen had arrived the runcibles reversed to transmit evacuees to Isostations. the dracomen nearby began forcing them through. meanwhile Azroc’s forces finally reached a point Coloron considered far enough from the previously enclosed area of the arcology.

[h|firing particle cannon], Coloron sent.

the turquoise beam spat down from the toroidal satellite, struck a maize field and turned it into a firestorm, bored down into earth, then through composite layers, and deep into the arcology, precisely down the axis of the affected cylindrical section. in sight of Azroc’s forces, fire blasted from corridors, across urban parks, through shopping arcades, and sports or VR centres. it blew people along with it like burning leaves. the Coloron AI calculated that with just that one blast it killed over forty thousand inhabitants. the tentacular Jain structure began spreading out of the wreckage, fingering out of ventilation shafts and oozing sluglike along split electrical and optic ducts, and this confirmed to the AI that many of them were as good as dead already. the AI watched that growth slow down gradually to a stop, and dared to hope. then abruptly the Jain substructure waved its spiky fingers to dismiss hope, and surged on.

Coloron broadcast through the remaining server network, and via public screens and address systems: [h|urgent evacuation order: a hostile alien organic technology is attempting to take over MA].

on the screens the AI displayed scenes of what was happening. it took it a full two seconds to calculate how best its order should be carried out. some sections could be evacuated via the runcibles, others would have to make use of the exits around the arcology perimeter. an external zone would have to be set up to quarantine MA from the rest of the planet, to prevent any physical manifestation of this invading technology from escaping, but allowing enough room to get inhabitants out of the arcology itself. Corolon assigned a submind to the vast logistical problem of moving a billion souls to safety, and knew, with mathematical certainty, that those forty thousand dead were only the start.

ten yards above the floor, one set of her assister-frame limbs gripping a rung set into the crashfoam-covered wall behind her, Orlandine studied her latest creation. precisely in the centre of the chamber, the yard-wide gimbals device was supported within a light scaffold of bubble-metal poles attached to the floor and ceiling. its outer two rings served to present any facet of an inner spherical framework to three telescopic heads. One of those heads now contained plasmonic lens gear from a nanoscope she had taken apart inside the ship, another came from the nanoassembler, which could also be utilized as a disassembler, and the third was a submolecular scanner. the Jain node itself was clamped centrally in the inner framework by six equidistantly spaced chainglass points. this whole, the framework and chainglass clamps, made no physical contact with the outer rings, for it was buoyed and rotated by magnetic fields. the two outer rings were also enclosed in a shimmer-shield sphere out of which, even now, the air was being evacuated. studying the Jain node underneath a nanoscope, she felt to be too dangerous now, for every time she drew close to it the visible activity on its surface increased. Orlandine could only suppose that inside it some additional host-identification program had come online.

there were safer ways to do this, layer upon layer of security protocols, shell upon shell of vacuum and armour, and even layers of automated weapons. she could in fact have automated everything here and studied the node from a few thousand miles away. however, it seemed to her that now its only method of affecting the outside world was informationally via the optic cables leading from the sensory heads, which it could do even if she was a long way away and even if every gun in the Polity was pointed at this thing. but this present set-up was similar to the one she had used back at the Cassius Project, when she accepted that, in studying something like this, certain dangers were inherently unavoidable, and before she got scared, destroyed all her equipment there, and returned the node to its case in her quarters. Orlandine rubbed her two human hands together. time to go to work.

rather than go immediately into some virtuality to assess scanning data, she clambered down the rungs to the floor, then stepped over to where skeins of optic cable connected to the computer hardware and screen through which she controlled the nanoscope, disassembler and submolecular scanner  --  all three now working synergetically. for her initial scans she decided not to connect herself directly to these devices, so instead employed a simple touchboard and interactive screen system. using the board she called up an image of the node, laid a grid over it, and focused down on one single square. this square then divided into a grid from which she selected another square, then down and down in size until she could see actual molecular structures, then back to reveal the nodal landscape. she next set previously constructed programs to analysing the structures detected. as expected, this was like trying to understand an entire civilization from a pot shard.

<e>too slow</e>.

Orlandine shrugged to herself. this exercise was only to see how the Jain node might react to investigation. as yet it remained inert. she continued scanning different areas of it but revealing only what she had found before: pores twenty angstroms wide with chain molecules coiled inside each like a jellyfish sting; isotopic gold threads; a matrix of photo-optic and piezo-electric compounds linked by s-con carbon fullerene nanotubes. these it used to first sense its host, then begin taking over. finally, after hours of investigation necessarily distanced by console and screen, frustration drove her to move in closer  --  something she had not risked before.

First she removed the console from the equation and began controlling the equipment by radio emission from her carapace, then impatient with this she plugged direct optic links into it. subsequently, the screen definition and speed began to annoy her, so she projected the images directly into her visual cortex. it was then but a small step to move on into a virtuality.

in her virtual world mere thought became action, and that world contained no representation of herself, merely her godlike omniscience. she began creating subpersonae, choosing and assigning areas of study to them, and collating their data output herself. the submolecular scanner managed to penetrate up to a hundred angstroms into the node’s surface, and that, combined with the nanoscope views of the surface itself, enabled her to begin constructing a model of its outer layers. the scanner also revealed regular quantum entanglement in silica crystals  --  a sure sign that they were quantum processors. simple connections could then be divined: sensory apparatus connected to processors, which in turn connected to the [h|stinging pores] and to structures deeper inside. allowing her subpersonae to continue working, she mentally sat back and considered what she was doing and why.

this piece of alien nanotechnology contained deliberate quantum levels of arrangement that might even define some of it as picotech. it was packed solid, this little egg, and probably nothing inside it was without purpose. this consequently inferred that, as a whole, its purpose must be huge. she already knew that purpose: it grew, it subjugated and subsumed, it destroyed. however, she also understood that this node was probably a key to a whole alien technology.

<e>knowledge is power</e> ….

learning its secrets might take her beyond what she was, beyond subservience to AIs, or to anything. <e>her</e> purpose then was the pursuit of knowledge which would result in increased ability to manipulate her environment  --  which was after all one basis of haiman philosophy.

Skellor had used such a node and was either destroyed by it or by those who hunted him. this would not happen to her. fortunately ECS warned her what a node like this could do before this one fell into her possession. when she first removed it from the case, she had taken the precaution of not touching it, in fact of opening it in a vacuum-sealed tank. perhaps the expectation of those who passed it on to her had been for her to take no such precautions …. outside of its case the node did not at first react to its environment  --  the ceramal tongues she used to handle it, the chainglass shelf it rested on, the inert gas inside the display cabinet  --  so what <e>precisely</e> did it react to?. she was told it responded to intelligent, technological beings, but how did it identify them?.

Orlandine returned her attention to the data gathered by her subpersonae. interestingly one of them had revealed sensory structures capable of reacting to the molecular components of their environment. by making comparative analysis she realized the node’s sensorium was somewhat superior to that of a human being. however, inside the display case it had been in contact with nothing but inert gas and chainglass, therefore, from its shelf in the display, it must have <e>seen</e> her. this thought led nowhere, however. she realized that the only real way to learn how the node operated was to extract one of those silica crystals, one of those quantum computers, and find out exactly what it contained.

in the first moments Thellant felt trapped in a net of white-hot wires. movement squirmed throughout his body, tearing, shifting, connecting. his skull felt ready to burst and when he pressed a hand to his forehead, bone and skin shifted underneath it. his sight faded, sounds became dull and echoey, then disappeared altogether. when his lungs shut down and he began to suffocate, he panicked but there was nothing he could do: he just lay paralysed in that same spot. but he could feel more closely than before his connection to his Dracocorp aug and to the network over which it held primacy. information flowed random and chaotic, but the sheer quantity of it he perceived inside his own head was huge, and somehow being read by something else that was becoming part of him. however, as that information flow increased, his consciousness faded.

<e>bastard Legate</e> ….

flashes of perception: a group of four men standing in a corridor ranting about the shortage of their favourite beer; a woman having an orgasm in some VR fantasy about Golem lovers; hunger and growth  --  finding a power cell and the intricate components of an atmosphere monitor, pulling those apart, pulling the cell apart, feeding and spreading down an optic cable while reading its traffic on the way; a second wave of support substructure spiralling like a vine around the outside of the cable afterwards, digesting the coating to create itself; a fusion reactor, connection, and surge of intoxicating power with a concomitant surge of growth; then sight returning.

<e>where are you, Legate?</e>.

Dracocorp network. millions bending to his will to ask that question and none other.

something of self returned, and at its core rested hate for the Legate. Thellant gazed across his apartment. he now sat against the wall, his back to the primary outlets to his computer system. he did not remember moving  --  he had been <e>moved</e> . every part of him hurt badly, yet he was not breathing. from rips in his trousers grey vinelike growth had spread across the carpet, penetrated the floor, spread up the walls. wherever there was a power outlet or optic port, it had bunched, then branched. hairlike rootish tendrils spread from the larger branches, and wherever they lay it seemed someone had poured acid. One growth had reached his com console and branched out all over it. the console, screen, desk and even chair were gone, and now only Jain substructure outlined their shapes. but, when he thought about all the data he once securely stored there, he could sense it, feel its availability to him. and there was so much more he could know.

millions of eyes and ears became available to him. similar to the facility available to him through his aug, he could cast his perception out and away from him: corridors, parks, lidos, VR chambers and autofactories. he encompassed a vast area, but that was not all. mobile sensory apparatus also came under his control, and it took him a moment to realize these were human beings absorbed into the growing structure like everything else  --  extensions of himself. they spread out from him, the vanguard of his <e>growth</e> . they armed themselves, those that could. it was preprogrammed: everything not himself, not Jain, was the enemy.

then he found the gulf, a region previously occupied by his extended structure and now blacked out. nearby he found a child, one side of her body burnt down to the bone, but muscles still capable of obeying the impulses of the mycelial structure inside her. he stood her up, walked her into this black area. within minutes she moved through incinerated corridors to the edge of a well cut down through the arcology. the area below looked like the pit of hell; above curtains of smoke blew across open sky. satellite strike. the AI must have acted drastically to destroy the centre of Jain growth. Thellant understood at once a basic growth pattern implicit in the Jain structure. it grew <e>acentric</e> precisely to avoid this. he, the core, lay not at its centre but right against one edge of the current spread. he must move before the AI realized its mistake. but how?.

the <e>how</e> became utter and immediate temptation. he did not need to be Thellant, he could <e>become</e> all and lose himself in this vast and ever-increasing extension of himself. but a life of being a distinct entity, ever the centre, ever in control, made that option antithetical to him. he resisted it with all his will and fought to retake the territory of his own body. turning perception inward, he studied what had been wrought and what had been wrecked within him. withdrawing growth inside himself he repaired damage. this was easy, everything destroyed had been recorded and everything recorded could be rebuilt.

within minutes he restarted his heart and lungs. alterations to some structures in his brain negated pain signals, oxygenated blood reaching his brain returned to him much of what he had been. but in the end he realized he could not return to being a completely distinct human being. that way he would sacrifice too much perception and too much power, and so many of his former body’s organs were inefficient, weak. now, totally incorporating the structure into himself, he improved their function, their material, their strength. minutes passed before he realized, while laminating his bones with metals conveyed into him by the structure, that he was losing sight of his primary purpose. minutes after that he hauled himself from the floor, Jain structure turned brittle all around him, and breaking away. but he did not entirely separate from it. perpetually in contact across the electromagnetic spectrum, the air about him hazed with power. now he was as mobile as those other humans, but he was the prime component, <e>in control</e> . leaving his apartment he first walked, then ran, finding his way down, deep.
